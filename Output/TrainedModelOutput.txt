|b'Coming of age: the Gen Z losers saving cinema \xe2\x80\x93 and the worldKayla Day does not drink or smoke. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk back to her teachers. The time the 13-year-old at the centre of the new film Eighth Grade \xe2\x80\x93 played by Elsie Fisher \xe2\x80\x93 spends outside lessons is wholesomely productive. She makes upbeat YouTube videos about how crucial it is to be your most authentic self. (\xe2\x80\x9cBeing yourself can be hard, and it\xe2\x80\x99s like, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I always being myself?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks). But Day is also isolated, menaced by self-doubt and subject to panic attacks. As such, she is the perfect modern teenage heroine: the terrified voice of Generation Z. Among the movie\xe2\x80\x99s early fans was Molly Ringwald, star of The Breakfast Club. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best film about adolescence I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in long time,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted after a screening. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe ever.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a plum endorsement, a passing of the torch from a state-of-the-generation classic that had itself called back to the spiritual starting point of Rebel Without a Cause. The miracle of Eighth Grade is reflecting the depression and anxiety of its subjects while also being funny and charming. It had to change the rules of the coming-of-age movie to do it. The film was made by Bo Burnham, a gifted first-time director, lauded comedian and YouTuber. If you wanted to represent the teenager of 2019, social media is an obvious but useful place to start \xe2\x80\x93 this being the first generation to pass through childhood with a smartphone. The predictable storyline would be an expos\xc3\xa9 of cyberbullying or a nightmarish slipping down internet rabbit holes. But Burnham has a more subtle tale to tell. If the glittering pitch for life online was that anyone could write or play or simply be anything in front of a watching world, the catch eventually became evident \xe2\x80\x93 that the world would be watching cat videos instead. (Kayla calls her latest vlog, Putting Yourself Out There, even as the view count for the others stalls at 1, 2 or 0.) The result is a kind of radical loneliness-in-a-crowd that teen movies have never before had to deal with. Social media also short circuits their neat binary logic: olds on one side, pesky kids the other. Now, technology has united generations. Research suggests dependence on connected devices is a common thread in age groups from pre-teens on TikTok to elderly racists on Facebook. It also endlessly sub-divides us. In Eighth Grade, Kayla encounters a group of high school seniors, aghast at the fact that she had Snapchat at nine. But if 13-year-olds regard 16-year-olds as grown-up, they see 26-year-olds as antique. The real-life gulf between cohorts is vast. In the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, the young were shut out of the housing market and forced to live with their parents; the young that followed have parents hobbled by the crash. Rates of depression among Generation Z teenagers have been found to be two-thirds higher than among millennials at the same age. No surprise then that millennial coming-of-age movies \xe2\x80\x93 Juno, say, or Scott Pilgrim vs the World \xe2\x80\x93 feel like loud relics of a distant era. The last time a 13-year-old girl was the subject of a high-profile US film, it was Thirteen, directed by Catherine Hardwicke in 2003. Evan Rachel Wood was cast as delinquent Tracy, whose anger at her mother played out in sexualised behaviour and huffing cans of gas duster. The film left many critics shaken (\xe2\x80\x9cChilling,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Hollywood Reporter). In fact, even then it felt strangely old-fangled, a variation on a theme unchanged since James Dean. Now, another new coming-of-age film turns the clock back again \xe2\x80\x93 Jonah Hill making his first movie as a director with Mid90s, set in the decade of the title. Nostalgia hangs thick. Hill spent a chunk of his youth hanging out at the Los Angeles skateboard shop Hot Rod, his experience filtered into the story of a troubled 13-year-old among a wolfpack of skaters. Fans of the Harmony Korine-scripted Kids will have their memories liberally jogged. While the adolescent sex that made that film such a hot potato in 1995 is given a gentler spin, Hill still goes big on underage drink and drugs, the traditional basics for intergenerational moral panic. To set the film in 2019 would feel ridiculous, and not just because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all before. Real teenage life has transformed. Recent research that found British young people disclosing mental health issues on an industrial scale also reported dwindling use of drugs and alcohol. (Self-harm is skyrocketing). If such a staple of teen drama is now old hat, the question it asked is redundant, too. What is it that makes these kids so messed up? Do we really need to ask? Every London teen has to navigate streets where other teens are stabbed to death. In the US, school shootings have become routine. Last year, 113 people were killed or injured in school shootings in the US. Unsurprisingly, American teens have reported fear of gun violence as a primary cause of anxiety. In the course of Eighth Grade, Kayla and her classmates carry out an \xe2\x80\x9cactive shooter drill\xe2\x80\x9d. Kids being kids, they slump bored against the nearest wall, the victims freckled with fake blood. Step back further and the problem is bigger even than guns. While postwar children grew up fearful of possible nuclear war, every 13-year-old now has to wrestle with climate change. Last summer in Stockholm, another quiet teenager lost patience with the adult world. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always been that girl in the back who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Greta Thunberg told the Guardian recently. Yet suddenly, she did. Taking a cue from the US students who walked out of lessons after Parkland to call for tighter gun laws, Thunberg \xe2\x80\x93 then 15 \xe2\x80\x93 began weekly school strikes outside the Swedish parliament in protest at government inertia over climate change. Other strikers, such 13-year-old Scot Holly Gillibrand, were inspired in turn. Eventually, around 1.4 million young people worldwide left their classrooms this month to demand action on climate. Even before Eighth Grade, a different kind of youth has been showing up on screen. Chiewetel Ejiofor\xe2\x80\x99s The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind told the story of the Malawian teenager William Kamkwamba whose self-taught engineering projects rescued his village from famine. In The Kid Who Would Be King, director Joe Cornish charged a suburban 12-year-old with dragging Britain back from the brink of destruction. If young people are going to have to fix the world, the coming-of-age film will need to keep pace. In the era of Rebel Without a Cause, an older audience would be nervous and mystified. Now, the fear runs only one way. Teenagers are scared of adults: how we vote, buy, drive, fly. Reading the research on their mental health, Generation Z can feel heartbreakingly remote. Watching Day in Eighth Grade \xe2\x80\x93 stumbling red-faced, nursing crushes, looking forward \xe2\x80\x93 you realise she is exactly like the rest of us. Then your heart breaks again.'

|b'Billie Eilish: When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? review \xe2\x80\x93 thrilling Gen Z terror-popOld people (in this case, anyone over about 23) may be quick to cite Billie Eilish\xe2\x80\x99s obvious influences as evidence of the 17-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s unoriginality: Lana Del Rey\xe2\x80\x99s broken balladry, Lorde\xe2\x80\x99s hip-hop-adjacent pop minimalism and witch house\xe2\x80\x99s lo-fi spookiness all seethe through her debut. Eilish doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that she is a product of an online adolescence, steeped in a pop cultural morass with no beginning or end. But what she does with those influences is unique. Like a horror auteur, Eilish uses intimacy to amplify scares. She sings in a discomfitingly close gasp, like an ASMR actor having a panic attack. Her well turned melodies often unfold like haunted music box ditties or ghostly show tunes, and suddenly snatch away to expose an annihilating lyric: \xe2\x80\x9cThe way I\xe2\x80\x99m drinking you down / Like I wanna drown / Like I wanna end me,\xe2\x80\x9d she admits, coolly, on standout Bury a Friend. Her eerie softness contrasts with her brother Finneas\xe2\x80\x99s compellingly nasty production, laced with menacing bass (Bad Guy) chilling foley (the scraped swords that open You Should See Me in a Crown) and unsettling textural detonations that match anything produced by PC Music. The highs are thrilling, and despite their obvious pedigree, arranged unlike anything else in contemporary pop. They also reveal the lows more starkly: the saccharine, coyly suggestive 8, played on a ukulele, and I Love You, which sounds suspiciously like Hallelujah, are better off left to YouTube ingenues than an artist of Eilish\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise clear vision.'

|b'Experience: I regularly smash things in a rage roomFour years ago, I was celebrating a friend\xe2\x80\x99s birthday at an activity centre in Toronto. By the reception desk, we noticed a video stream of two men in a room. One was throwing empty wine bottles to the other, who was then obliterating them with baseball bat. We could hear the shattering noises, and our small group stood transfixed. I felt an urge to go inside and smash some glass myself. Everyone was keen to show how tough they were \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps the effect of lingering endorphins after the morning\xe2\x80\x99s Nerf gun battle. I handed over the cash and put on protective overalls and a mask, before venturing into the rage room with a friend. Our half-hour session was surreal. We started tentatively but were soon giving it everything. We teed up bottles on a pedestal, and destroyed a printer; we tried all the weapons \xe2\x80\x93 hammers, baseball bats, tennis rackets, an axe \xe2\x80\x93 and jokingly suggested rage-inducing scenarios. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine finding your boyfriend in bed with your cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d I told my friend. By the end, I knew I would be back. Within a month, I was going at least once a week; since that first session I have spent CA$6,000 (\xc2\xa33,488) at Battle Sports, Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s rage room. I have a mild case of Peter Pan syndrome, and a reputation as the wacky adventurer of our group, so none of my friends was concerned about my new hobby. At the beginning, I would pay CA$25 (\xc2\xa314.50) for a light session of about 15 minutes, mostly with glass bottles, but I soon progressed to heavier goods: CA$45 for about 40 minutes with printers and television sets. These days, I get a discount. It was partly the stresses of work that led me to the rage room. I am an entertainer trying to catch a break in film and television, but I still need to pay the rent. Standup comedy, music video production and small acting roles help me get by. I also provide services such as casting and consulting through my production company. The work is great, but it can be frustrating to be denied a bigger slice of stardom. Last year, I had six call-backs for a role in a Seth Rogen show before learning that someone else got the part. In the rage room, all kinds of images came into my head: the script, the audition waiting room, the feedback. I let a lot go, that day. Romantic pressures also play a part. I see friends settling down, getting married, starting families. Dates bring heavy expectation \xe2\x80\x93 women my age want to meet \xe2\x80\x9cthe one\xe2\x80\x9d. Each encounter feels as if it should be the last. It is stressful. Coincidentally, the rage room is a great place to take a date. Going as a pair makes you more creative. You play games, get competitive, see who can get the cleanest strike. There is beauty in the destruction: white-stress fractures emerging on a plastic printer; jagged cracks running along TV screens; stitches bursting loose from upholstery. Some objects are more resistant than others, which seem designed to break at the slightest touch. My favourite weapon is the crowbar \xe2\x80\x93 it has a nice weight, like a sword. Baseball bats also feel good. Sometimes I put on the Game Of Thrones music as I bring the weapons down, ruining any microwave that dares to defy me. Before discovering the rage room, I tried all kinds of ways to deal with stress: karaoke, trampoline, dodgeball, the gym. Going to the gym is about getting healthy, looking good, but when I\xe2\x80\x99m smashing up toasters, the intent is different. When I behave like a caveman, I leave any negativity behind. The rage room is a place of honest reflection. During one session, a year and a half after a break up, the words of my ex came into my head: \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think you put enough effort into this relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought this criticism was unfair. In a flash of inspiration and broken glass, I realised I had been holding on to that thought for too long. I grew up in care and never knew the date of my birthday; and I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t fully realised my dream. But if the rage room has taught me anything, it is that I am not an angry person. I don\xe2\x80\x99t experience rage before, during or after a session. The whole process feels like a calm and controlled release. It is extremely liberating. I think everyone could use a visit. \xe2\x80\xa2 As told to Sam Bradpiece \xe2\x80\xa2 Do you have an experience to share?

|b'Madeline Miller: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m always knocked over by how funny Moby-Dick is\xe2\x80\x99The book I am currently reading A handful of academic books about The Tempest serving as research and inspiration, as well as Audre Lorde\xe2\x80\x99s Your Silence Will Not Protect You. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the midst of two rereads: Ann Patchett\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing memoir of a friendship, Truth and Beauty, and Victor LaValle\xe2\x80\x99s The Changeling, a brilliant novel of modern-day mythological realism. The books that changed my life There are many. Homer\xe2\x80\x99s The Iliad and The Odyssey are the obvious answers. Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s Aeneid was so profound and exciting it moved me from nerdy enthusiasm to actual classical scholarship. Isabel Allende\xe2\x80\x99s The House of the Spirits showed me that books can fill you with both rage and awe. Lorrie Moore\xe2\x80\x99s witty precision made me want to be a writer. And Shakespeare: directing his plays taught me so much of what I know about storytelling. The book I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d written Books are too personal to be able to swap writers, I think. Still, Lily King\xe2\x80\x99s Father of the Rain. The book that is most overrated I usually have the opposite problem. People tell me over and over that I should read a book, and I start thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, how good can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d Then I finally read it, and suddenly I\xe2\x80\x99m that person grabbing people by the sleeve and pressing it on them. This happened most recently with Min Jin Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Pachinko. The book that influenced my writing Every book I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever read, one way or another. Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s learning what to avoid. The last book that made me cry John Boyne\xe2\x80\x99s The Heart\xe2\x80\x99s Invisible Furies. On a plane, which is really saying something. Also, 50% of the children\xe2\x80\x99s books in our house. The last book that made me laugh Lindy West\xe2\x80\x99s Shrill. Hilarious, keen-edged, wonderful. The book I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish After devouring The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien as a child, I stalled on The Lord of the Rings. I\xe2\x80\x99m intending to give it another shot one of these days. The book I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed not to have read I prefer guilt to shame. If there\xe2\x80\x99s a book I feel I really need to read, I buy it, and put it in a prominent place. That way I can convince myself that I\xe2\x80\x99m about to open it, and also chastise myself daily because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. My earliest reading memory My mom used to read to me at bedtime, and one night we finished at a particularly exciting moment in Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by Robert C O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. As she turned out the light she said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t go reading the end by yourself with a flashlight.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWHAT? You can do that?!\xe2\x80\x9d That was the beginning of years of secret nighttime reading. My comfort reading Watership Down by Richard Adams. Heartburn by Nora Ephron. Herman Melville\xe2\x80\x99s Moby-Dick, which always knocks me over with how funny it is. I love Ishmael\xe2\x80\x99s voice. The book I give as a gift I love giving children\xe2\x80\x99s books to kids. I have never seen Blue Hat, Green Hat by Sandra Boynton fail to make a child laugh. Up in the Tree by Margaret Atwood is terrifically strange and funny, Journey by Aaron Becker is enchanting without a single word. I like Not Quite Narwhal by Jessie Sima for its sweetness, and Kitchen Dance by Maurie J Manning makes me wish I danced more often doing the dishes. \xe2\x80\xa2 Madeline Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Circe, longlisted for the Women\xe2\x80\x99s prize for fiction, is out in paperback from Bloomsbury on 1 April.

|b'Joaqu\xc3\xadn Sorolla\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: floating in a blissful sea of white bed linenMother of invention \xe2\x80\xa6 This painting from 1895-1900 is the brilliant standout in Joaqu\xc3\xadn Sorolla\xe2\x80\x99s career. It shows his wife and muse Clotilde and their newly born daughter Elena. The set-up is strange and striking: they are heads only, floating in a blissful sea of white bed linen, gentle sunlight and soft shadows. In his nature \xe2\x80\xa6 Sorolla\xe2\x80\x99s ambition was to \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy all conventionality\xe2\x80\x9d, yet this is one of the few occasions when he did smash convention. While borrowing impressionist ideas, his vision was embedded in old-fashioned figurative painting. His youthful bodies slick with sea spray, blooming gardens and scenes of traditional Spanish life made him the popular hit of his day. A radical he was not. Pale and interesting \xe2\x80\xa6 Light was the Spanish artist\xe2\x80\x99s stock-in-trade and in Mother he lets rip, giving himself over to ebullient shades of white. Family first\xe2\x80\xa6 A compulsive worker, he once produced 80 beach paintings in one summer. His favourite subject, though, was his family. Elena would become a regular model, painted from cradle to adulthood.

|b'Edwyn Collins: Badbea review \xe2\x80\x93 arch punk provocateur ages defiantlyEdwyn Collins\xe2\x80\x99 ninth solo album carries the unmistakable air of a man looking back, lyrically and musically. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the title track, a lament for the hard lives of the Highlanders in a tiny village that is now \xe2\x80\x9ca ruined monument to life and death\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s there in Outside, in which fuzzed, frantic Ramones guitars are accompanied by a lyric repeating that band\xe2\x80\x99s old mantra of \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x9d. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the defiance of youth that makes him uncaring: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m old, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d That theme is picked up on Glasgow to London, on which Collins reflects on how there was a time \xe2\x80\x9cAmbition drove my life / Now I\xe2\x80\x99m old I must admit I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a fuck.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say this is a recorded equivalent of one of those Grumpy Old Men talking heads\xe2\x80\x99 shows on TV. Even when Collins is excoriating selfishness on It\xe2\x80\x99s All About You, he does so with the same arch beauty he employed back in the Orange Juice days: \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun was a bright bikini yellow / The sky was a Wedgwood blue / The mood was unspeakably mellow / When you came and spoilt the view.\xe2\x80\x9d You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call Badbea wildly original; it\xe2\x80\x99s filled with references to Collins\xe2\x80\x99s musical touchstones (northern soul; the Velvet Underground) and an explicit melodic link to Big Star\xe2\x80\x99s Feel in I\xe2\x80\x99m OK Jack. But Collins is in fine voice, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always a pleasure to have him back.'

|b'Prisoner by Jason Rezaian review \xe2\x80\x93 544 days in an Iranian prisonWhen Jason Rezaian launched \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iranian Avocado Quest\xe2\x80\x9d on Kickstarter in 2010, he was hoping to get a bit of viral interest, maybe a few freelance features, and some laughs out of it. The foodie journalist, who, while he still lived in California, competed in the Marin County Guac-off (guidelines: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only requirement is the presence of 10 avocados \xe2\x80\x93 the rest is your interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d), was shocked to find that his father\xe2\x80\x99s homeland, Iran, was an avocado-free zone. The idea was to raise enough money to start a farm in the Islamic republic, or rather to have some fun trying and failing to do so. The fact that this was interpreted as a CIA plot by Rezaian\xe2\x80\x99s interrogators during his 544-day spell as a political prisoner speaks volumes: of the cultural cluelessness of his captors, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), even as they struggle to wage a culture war against US influence (\xe2\x80\x9cWhy would people give other people they don\xe2\x80\x99t know money to try to accomplish meaningless things?\xe2\x80\x9d asks one officer, who refuses to believe that Kickstarter is real); of the utter baselessness of the charges against the man who had by that time become the Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Tehran correspondent; and of the tendency of all authoritarian systems to veer towards the absurd. Absurdities come thick and fast in this powerful memoir, published three years after an intensive diplomatic and media campaign secured Rezaian\xe2\x80\x99s release and escape from Iran with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi. After 47 nights in solitary confinement, he is put in a \xe2\x80\x9csuite\xe2\x80\x9d with an inmate who only speaks Azerbaijani and given access to a TV. They bond over a diet of American films, some heavily edited. The Big Lebowski is reduced to a mere 50 minutes: \xe2\x80\x9cNo white Russians, no marijuana smoking, no urinating, no Bunny Lebowski. Just a couple of guys bowling and a Persian rug.\xe2\x80\x9d Later, the men who have been regularly threatening him with execution suddenly take him on a shopping trip. They pick out ties for him at a department store and make him choose sweets at a patisserie before blindfolding him and returning him to jail. The deadpan humour Rezaian has clearly traded in his whole life survives, although it\xe2\x80\x99s tested to its limit. He\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly ballsy with the IRGC officers, given what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich one of you geniuses came up with that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks, when they suggest his marriage was orchestrated by the CIA and MI6. At one point, with his interrogators bizarrely goading him to sing, he replies: \xe2\x80\x9cOK, but you have to stand up.\xe2\x80\x9d They all rise, and he lets rip with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Star-Spangled Banner\xe2\x80\x9d, before telling them it\xe2\x80\x99s the American national anthem and as a result they have just committed treason. Rezaian resists the temptation to confess to being a spy, which he is told is the price of his immediate release. Instead he is honest about his work. Yes, he was attempting to paint a more accurate portrait of Iran for American readers, to make it intelligible to them, to humanise it. Unable to pin anything more sinister than this on him, the IRGC decides that his crime is to have encouraged a rapprochement between the two cultures. This might seem strange \xe2\x80\x93 particularly given that, at exactly the same time, Iranian and US leaders were conducting negotiations with broadly similar aims. But Iran is politically divided, with rival centres of power. The internal debate about its orientation towards the outside world is intense, and what reformists do may be contradicted by the actions of hardliners, more so at times when the former seem to be in the ascendant. That was the essence of Rezaian\xe2\x80\x99s problem \xe2\x80\x93 the tentative opening up that followed Hassan Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s election as president was seen as a threat by the IRGC, and he suffered the consequences. Prisoner touches on this complex politics, but it is above all a personal story, told with admirable frankness, and a humour that sometimes belies the darkness of the experience. Rezaian\xe2\x80\x99s time as, effectively, a hostage clearly changed him profoundly, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on the mental anguish that must have filled his days. The psychological repercussions are more clearly evident in the final pages of the book, as he describes life after the thriller-like climax of his release. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind \xe2\x80\x93 my memory and my focus \xe2\x80\x93 is still mush,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He becomes confused in crowds, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like talking on the phone. He gets strange headaches and screams in his sleep. To top it all, the IRS wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waive penalties for not filing his taxes on time while he was incarcerated. (The people who helped him sort this out are thanked in the long acknowledgements section, which is an unusually emotional read.) The abiding sense is of an imaginative reporter, a joker, a lover of life and a devoted husband broken on the wheel of a vindictive system. The hope must be that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals still held in Iran will one day get to write their own accounts, having, like Rezaian, been reunited with their families and spirited to safety.'

|b'What to see this week in the UKFive of the best ... films Us (15) (Jordan Peele, 2019, US) 116 mins Peele\xe2\x80\x99s follow-up to Get Out has become a bona fide phenomenon: top of the US box office and a second demonstration of Peele\xe2\x80\x99s ability to combine woke social analysis with mainstream commercial smarts. Lupita Nyong\xe2\x80\x99o could well be on for a second Oscar in her role as the woman who heads to a holiday home with her family, only to encounter a creepy group of doppelgangers outside. Dumbo (PG) (Tim Burton, 2019, US) 112 mins Opinion is somewhat divided on this latest attempt by Disney to re-up its back catalogue. Burton worked box-office magic with Alice in Wonderland, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think this won\xe2\x80\x99t do the same, with a live/CGI version of the flying-elephant tale. But there have been mutterings over changes to key scenes and characters from the original. Out of Blue (15) (Carol Morley, 2018, US/UK) 109 mins After winning many admirers with her 2014 girls\xe2\x80\x99 school drama The Falling, Carol Morley offers up an existential cop noir, starring Patricia Clarkson and set in New Orleans. Adapted from Martin Amis\xe2\x80\x99s 1997 novel Night Train, Out of Blue follows Clarkson\xe2\x80\x99s detective as she investigates the death of a brilliant astrophysicist. But rather than turn it into a whodunnit, Morley follows Amis\xe2\x80\x99s lead to engage with the audience\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual capacities. Border (15) (Ali Abbasi, 2019, Swe) 110 mins The Iran-born director has come up with a freaky fable of outsiderdom. Eva Melander is the border guard with a superhuman sense of smell, who\xe2\x80\x99s largely alone and scorned until the arrival of the not dissimilar-looking Vore (Eero Milonoff). Much attention has been paid to the Cronenberg-ish sex scene, but there\xe2\x80\x99s an acute investigation of humanity going on here too. Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story (15) (Steve Sullivan, 2018, UK) 101 mins Eye-opening documentary about the man inside the big head. Chris Sievey was your standard post-punk musician until comedy character Frank Sidebottom took over his life. Sievey never talks about Sidebottom so actual answers are thin on the ground. Even so, this is still fascinating. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Giorgio Moroder At the tender age of 78, the godfather of disco, electronic pop and expertly coiffured moustaches heads out on his first ever European tour. Despite being billed confusingly as a Celebration of the 80s, expect to sway seductively to 1977\xe2\x80\x99s I Feel Love and sashay towards the bar for songs from 2015\xe2\x80\x99s messy D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 Vu album. Birmingham, Monday 1; London, Tuesday 2; Glasgow, Thursday 4; Manchester, Friday 5 April Nil\xc3\xbcfer Yanya Nil\xc3\xbcfer Yanya\xe2\x80\x99s recently released debut Miss Universe is a concept album about a fictional health management company. That makes it sound quite boring, actually, but in between the interludes is a selection of excellently skewed alt-rock parables that channel everyone from King Krule to Mitski to Sade. Glasgow, Wednesday 3; Manchester, Thursday 4; Leicester, Friday 5; touring to 14 April Hot Chip Four years after the dance-pop boffins\xe2\x80\x99 last album, Why Make Sense?, you\xe2\x80\x99d imagine Hot Chip have another collection of lithe, dinner party-ready electro bangers ready to drop at any moment. Perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll perform some new ones during these warm-up shows. Maybe they won\xe2\x80\x99t; that\xe2\x80\x99s just the risk you take with live music. Liverpool, Sunday 31 March; Glasgow, Monday 1; Manchester, Wednesday 3; London, Thursday 4; Brighton, Friday 5; touring to 6 April IAMDDB Billed as an \xe2\x80\x9curban jazz trailblazer\xe2\x80\x9d Manchester\xe2\x80\x99s IAMDDB, AKA Diana Debrito, ended last year supporting Ms Lauryn Hill at Wembley Arena before releasing her fifth EP of critically lauded, downtempo mood pieces, SWERVVVVV.5. Not bad for someone who quit university an hour into her first lecture, uploading her debut single that same day. Roundhouse, NW1, Thursday 4; touring to 7 April MC Vein Jazz\xe2\x80\x99s detractors sometimes grumble that the genre is a torrent of notes in search of a tune. Although Swiss acoustic piano trio Vein have dazzling improvising virtuosity to spare, they foreground strong melodies from all over contemporary and classical music, and are highly entertaining. UK saxophone star Andy Sheppard joins for their Bristol gig. The Flute &amp; Tankard, Cardiff, Wednesday 3; St George\xe2\x80\x99s, Bristol, Thursday 4 April JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Jack the Ripper: The Women of Whitechapel ENO\xe2\x80\x99s final Coliseum production this season is a world premiere. Composer Iain Bell and librettist Emma Jenkins\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the Jack the Ripper story concentrates on the five named victims of the East End killer rather than the murderer. The production, directed by Daniel Kramer and conducted by Martyn Brabbins, features some of ENO\xe2\x80\x99s most celebrated singers of recent decades, with appearances by Josephine Barstow, Susan Bullock, Lesley Garrett, Marie McLaughlin, Janis Kelly, Alan Opie and Robert Hayward. Coliseum, WC2, Sat to 12 April Weinberg\xe2\x80\x99s Violin Concerto Last autumn, Mirga Gra\xc5\xbeinyt\xc4\x97-Tyla and the CBSO devoted a weekend to the music of Mieczys\xc5\x82aw Weinberg. Now they follow it up with a performance of his 1959 Violin Concerto, featuring the orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s artist-in-residence, Gidon Kremer, as the soloist. Gra\xc5\xbeinyt\xc4\x97-Tyla\xe2\x80\x99s programme also includes a suite from Weinberg\xe2\x80\x99s puppet ballet The Golden Key, and it\xe2\x80\x99s framed with music by Schubert. Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Sunday 31 March Parry\xe2\x80\x99s Judith The centenary of the death of Hubert Parry last year was rather overshadowed by other musical anniversaries, but the revival of his oratorio Judith, claimed to be the first complete performance in London since the 19th century, provides some compensation. Premiered in 1888, its huge success established Parry\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a choral composer. This concert by London Mozart Players is conducted by William Vann, with Crouch End Festival Chorus and soloists including Sarah Fox. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Wednesday 3 April AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Filip Markiewicz Polish beer bottles, Mot\xc3\xb6rhead frontman Lemmy and Beethoven are among the cultural references thrown around like molotov cocktails in this exploration of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s contemporary crisis. Markiewicz contrasts the relentless cultural consumerism of our age with the realities of populist politics, refugees being victimised and terrorist violence. CCA, Derry, to 11 May Gary Hume Sinuous and insinuating abstract legs dangle and stretch in space in Hume\xe2\x80\x99s strange and troubling sculptures. Like his paintings, his carvings haunt a realm of the erotic suspended elegantly between pop culture and high art. Yet he focuses even more insistently on the sexual in these displays of imagined anatomy. A louche intruder in the English countryside. New Art Centre, Salisbury, to 12 May Bedwyr Williams The ancient and modern meet in a show called Hypercaust/ Y Tyrrau Mawr (The Big Towers) that combines images of a skyscraper city with memories of ancient Rome and its downfall. Hypercausts are ancient Roman heated floors whose remains can be seen in many archaeological sites. Williams mixes installations with standup comedy, and has the rare claim to be both collected by Charles Saatchi and a winner of the Welsh Eisteddfod. Southard Reid, W1, to 4 May Yinka Shonibare Shonibare\xe2\x80\x99s The British Library is a stylish and powerful riposte to those who would narrow British identity to some fictitious nativist rump. Shonibare has rebound a collection of great \xe2\x80\x9cBritish\xe2\x80\x9d books in ironically joyous print patterns that embody the history of colonial trade. They include classics by American immigrants TS Eliot and Henry James as well as books by and about migrants who made Britain great, from Hans Holbein to Anish Kapoor. Tate Modern, SE1, to November Ellen Gallagher In Gallagher\xe2\x80\x99s painting Bird in Hand, a one-legged pirate with a face that\xe2\x80\x99s part alien, part African mask sprouts a fantastic tree out of his head, while its roots caress his lower body. This mythic being is entwined in history \xe2\x80\x93 not so much a pirate of the Caribbean as a symbol of the African diaspora. It is hugely memorable and haunting, as well as comic, and the star of a strong showing of her art in this Artist Rooms collection. Tate Modern, SE1, to 17 November JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Top Girls Caryl Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s work always feels timely and freshly minted. But this is a particularly interesting time to stage Top Girls, a slippery and fascinating play about feminism, ambition and \xe2\x80\x9chaving it all\xe2\x80\x9d. Director Lyndsey Turner (recently involved in the Pinter at the Pinter season) should be a great fit: she is brilliant at holding on to the dreamy quality of unusual plays without surrendering their potency. National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1 to 22 June The Crucible Artistic director Jay Miller has created such a buzz around The Yard: it\xe2\x80\x99s a venue brimming with talent and full of surprises. This is the first time, however, that Miller has staged a classic. His version of Arthur Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Salem witch hunt drama The Crucible comes with a twist: John Proctor will be played by a woman Caoilfhionn Dunne. The Yard Theatre, E9, to 11 May Luke Wright: Poet Laureate Poet Luke Wright doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mince his words. His performances rumble with rage, passion and humour. They are also peppered with brilliantly smart observations. You will leave his show brimming with energy, heart pounding and brain whirring. In Luke Wright: Poet Laureate, Wright sets about penning a poem to unite a nation divided by austerity and Brexit. Can it be done? Probably not. But it will be fun to watch him try. Norwich Playhouse, Saturday 30 March; touring to 27 July Going Through Estelle Savasta\xe2\x80\x99s French play about child migration receives its UK premiere, in a translation by Kirsten Hazel Smith. Going Through is about a woman who is torn away from her deaf protector, to a new country and new life. The show mixes together English, British Sign Language and Creative Captioning and will be directed by Omar Elerian. If Elerian\xe2\x80\x99s past form is anything to go by, this should be a daring and powerful production. The Bush Theatre, W12, to 27 April The Jungle Book Derby Theatre has had a string of hits with its Christmas shows, including The Gingerbread Man and Goldilocks. Now, director Sarah Brigham and writer Neil Duffield are creating a new version of The Jungle Book for Easter, with music from regular collaborator Ivan Stott. Brigham and her team are total naturals at children\xe2\x80\x99s theatre, and their shows are beautifully observed and effortlessly absorbing. This should be a total charmer. Derby Theatre, Friday 5 to 20 April MG Three of the best ... dance shows Ferran Carvajal/Trevor Carlson: Not a Moment Too Soon Not exactly a dance performance, but fascinating viewing for anyone interested in one of modern dance\xe2\x80\x99s major icons, Merce Cunningham. Carlson was executive director of his company, and a companion to the choreographer in his later years. He revisits his memories in text, film and movement. Barbican: Silk Street Theatre, EC2 Thursday 4 to 6 April Scottish Ballet: Spring! Double bill marking Scottish Ballet\xe2\x80\x99s 50th-anniversary year. Sophie Laplane creates a new work, Dextera, weaving her leftfield language around the music of Mozart. This is balanced by a classic from the past, Kenneth MacMillan\xe2\x80\x99s jaunty Elite Syncopations, set to Scott Joplin. Inverness, Saturday 30; Glasgow, Thursday 4 to 6 April; touring to 4 May Russell Maliphant Company: Silent Lines A world premiere from Maliphant, Silent Lines builds on his research into anatomy and bodywork, drawing on the likes of capoeira, tai chi and yoga to create dreamily hypnotic dance in interplay with rippling light projections.

|b'Toxins in the air, toxins in the soil \xe2\x80\x93 still ministers won\xe2\x80\x99t act on GrenfellIt is news that no one wants to hear. Independent research from Prof Anna Stec at the University of Central Lancashire, released on Thursday, shows heightened levels of cancer-causing chemicals in the area around Grenfell Tower. Phosphorous flame retardants, toxic to the nervous system, were found in soil samples 50 metres from the tower. Dust and oily deposits were wiped from the blinds of homes close to the tower 17 months later. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at 160 times the level of reference samples 140m from Grenfell, along with chemicals that can cause asthma with a single exposure. These are not at naturally occurring levels in most urban environments. This is truly shocking. From the beginning, residents have asked the local authority and Public Health England about contamination. The problem was obvious. For days after the fire black smoke hung in the air, and contaminated homes, clothing and furniture. For months, charred black ash rained down on people\xe2\x80\x99s balconies, gardens, clothes lines and bins. Seven days after the fire the law firm Bindmans, acting for those affected, wrote to the local authority, Kensington and Chelsea, asking for urgent clarification and guidance. Was the area contaminated? Had a sampling programme begun? There was no response. At public meetings, residents asked Public Health England about the dust settling in their homes. They were told that this \xe2\x80\x9cwas not the kind of dust that gets into your lungs\xe2\x80\x9d. Air monitoring took place, but not immediately. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t test for the toxins found by researchers at the University of Central Lancashire. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t test the dust. Residents suffering from trauma, and those who have lost loved ones, now have to worry about what they and their children have been exposed to in their homes. They were told they were safe. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter being assured time and again about the risks of pollution following the fire, this report is alarming and hugely upsetting to read,\xe2\x80\x9d said the support group Grenfell United in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does nothing to build trust in our representatives and says more about managing civil unrest than a truthful duty of care and accountability by our public authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d In an update to residents, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government sought to reassure residents that it was \xe2\x80\x9ctaking Professor Stec\xe2\x80\x99s concerns extremely seriously\xe2\x80\x9d, and has \xe2\x80\x9cestablished a comprehensive programme of environmental checks to fully assess the risks and take appropriate action\xe2\x80\x9d. In reality, although an independent consultant, AECOM, has been appointed and residents have been advised to consult their GP if they have concerns, the government has yet to carry out a single soil test or offer a proper health screening programme to the community. The authorities have known about these risks all along. Why have they failed to act? Stec alerted them to her initial findings in February 2018. In September 2018, the Grenfell coroner wrote to the head of NHS England calling for a long-term screening programme for those exposed to fire and smoke, including firefighters and first responders. As with many issues arising from Grenfell, the authorities seem deaf to valid concerns, dismissing experts (Stec\xe2\x80\x99s initial findings were \xe2\x80\x9cnot peer reviewed\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 now they are), dismissing reports of the \xe2\x80\x9cGrenfell cough\xe2\x80\x9d as psychosomatic. There are echoes of the \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional indifference\xe2\x80\x9d (a phrase used by survivor Edward Daffarn to describe the authorities before the fire. This seems to have given way to institutional apathy. And \xe2\x80\x93 though this is a matter for the inquiry \xe2\x80\x93 there is a wider issue about the materials used, and the toxic load of the building. Stec\xe2\x80\x99s report identifies particular chemicals relating to the materials used in the refurbishment. As Grenfell United says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe report highlights just how toxic the materials manufactured by Arconic, Celotex and others are.\xe2\x80\x9d Toxicity must be considered in future legislation, to prevent deaths by toxic smoke, and those corporate entities and manufacturers must be held accountable. These delays should be unacceptable to us all. The authorities are supposed to protect us. The situation is unfolding in real time, with real consequences for residents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are trapped here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrea Newton, former chair of Lancaster West residents\xe2\x80\x99 association. \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Health England will never tell the truth [because] it will highlight their negligence, place RBKC [the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea] in a housing crisis, put central government in a huge financial predicament. The big players in housing, industry, property development and related manufacturers have too much to lose. They gain nothing from transparency.\xe2\x80\x9d Where is the urgency? At what point will the government act? This is a public health crisis in the making. The government must fulfil its obligations under the Environmental Protection Act. If we cannot trust our government to be candid, we must have legislation to force its hand. Toxins in the air. Toxins in the soil. The longer this goes on the more it becomes evident that legislation is needed. The public authorities accountability bill recommended by Bishop James Jones in his report on the Hillsborough disaster, must come back into play. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the government promise today they need to realise it\xe2\x80\x99s already too little and too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grenfell United. \xe2\x80\x9cTesting in the community must start immediately and by immediately, we mean yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d More information about NHS support services is available here .\xe2\x80\xa2 Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher.

|b'The Matthew Herbert Brexit Big Band: The State Between Us review \xe2\x80\x93 spacious political elegyThe Matthew Herbert Big Band are attempting something that so far seems beyond our politicians: \xe2\x80\x9cTo work out what a new kind of relationship with our European neighbours may look like.\xe2\x80\x9d This BPI-funded project has taken Herbert to Syria, China and Russia and has provided work for more than 1,000 musicians from across the European Union. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a very big Band, although the project has perhaps lost some impact by no longer coinciding with the now-delayed Brexit. Still, as the wheels of democracy grind, The State Between Us certainly offers space for reflection. These 16 mostly elegiac tracks consider what it means to be British. Pensive strings nestle against gloomy choirs, the sounds of second world war aircraft, factories being demolished and a Ford Fiesta being scrapped. An A-Z of Endangered Animals makes a sad point, using the noises of threatened species. Occasional vocalist Rahel Debebe-Dessalegne brings a touch of Dusty Springfield to You\xe2\x80\x99re Welcome Here, which soulfully extends a hand of friendship to refugees, although at almost 11 minutes, it threatens to outstay its welcome. Glenn Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Moonlight Serenade is rendered close to the original, and there\xe2\x80\x99s much needed light relief when Fish and Chips combines a \xe2\x80\x9cdeep-fried trumpet\xe2\x80\x9d (recorded at Brenda\xe2\x80\x99s Chippie, Cleethorpes) with a jaunty, brassy melody. However, with too many dirge-like instrumentals, the album is overlong, under-focused and, like the Brexit process, hard work.'

|b'House prices in England fall for first time since 2012House prices fell in England for the first time in seven years in the first three months of 2019, dragged lower by the traditional property hotspots of London and the south-east in a sign that Brexit turmoil is putting off buyers. Prices fell 0.7% in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2018, taking the average price of a home in England down to \xc2\xa3255,683, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. The biggest drag came from London, where an annual price fall of 3.8% in the three months to March was the biggest since the UK was in the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. It was the seventh consecutive quarter of falling prices in the capital, with many homebuyers unable to afford a house after a run of strong price rises in previous years. London prices have also been hit by a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes, which has dampened buyer appetite. Meanwhile, international buyers traditionally attracted by the property market in the capital are being deterred by Brexit uncertainty, according to analysts. The latest Nationwide report suggested Brexit uncertainty and the effects of a weaker London market are starting to ripple through to the wider south-east, where prices fell by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the same period a year earlier. Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said the traditional spring bounce in the housing market was \xe2\x80\x9cnowhere to be seen\xe2\x80\x9d. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Brexit handbrake is being ratcheted ever tighter in the south-east. With prices in the capital now falling at their fastest rate for a decade, London\xe2\x80\x99s seven successive quarters of declining prices can no longer be dismissed as a brief correction.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide, said the housing market in the UK overall was subdued in March, with average prices 0.7% higher than the same month last year at \xc2\xa3213,102. \xe2\x80\x9cMeasures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors report that new buyer inquiries have continued to decline, falling to their lowest level since 2008 in February,\xe2\x80\x9d Gardner said. Despite the fall in London house prices, the capital remains the most expensive place to buy a property by some margin, with average prices of \xc2\xa3455,594 more than twice the national average.'

|b'Football transfer rumours: Antoine Griezmann to Barcelona for \xc2\xa3100m?Now that Ole Gunnar Solskj\xc3\xa6r has the Manchester United job under lock and key, he can stop pretending that he cares about promoting youth. Give Ole the moolah! The Norwegian\xe2\x80\x99s already drawn up an expensive shopping list, with Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Jadon Sancho, Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Wan-Bissaka, West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Declan Rice, Napoli\xe2\x80\x99s Kalidou Koulibaly and Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Raphael Varane prominent in his thoughts. Ed Woodward had better have the chequebook ready. However, United will have to be careful when they give Real Madrid a call about Varane, as the struggling Spaniards might respond by asking how much they want for Paul Pogba. Madrid are said to be planning a \xc2\xa3125m bid for Pogba and have already made themselves more attractive to the Frenchman by not appointing Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho as their new manager. If Pogba proves out of reach, however, Zinedine Zidane will settle for nabbing Adrien Rabiot from Paris-Saint Germain for nothing. Zidane could also try to lure Kylian Mbapp\xc3\xa9 away from PSG while he\xe2\x80\x99s at it, even though any move for the striker would probably wipe out most of his \xe2\x82\xac500m summer budget, and the Madrid manager is also interested in signing Eden Hazard from Chelsea. Elsewhere in Spain Antoine Griezmann is mulling over taking a \xc2\xa36m pay cut to leave Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid for Barcelona, who are prepared to trigger the striker\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3100m buyout clause. Bar\xc3\xa7a could finance that deal by selling Samuel Umtiti to Arsenal. Meanwhile, they have been told to forget about taking Phil Foden off Manchester City. Chelsea plan to convince Callum Hudson-Odoi to stay at Stamford Bridge by offering the winger a contract worth \xc2\xa3100,000 a week. It would probably be cheaper just to give him a few games, you know. Juventus are considering triggering Toby Alderweireld\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa325m buyout clause and Wolves are on the verge of completing a \xc2\xa330m deal for Ra\xc3\xbal Jim\xc3\xa9nez, who will score two goals next season.'

|b'Nathan Chen v Yuzuru Hanyu: the rivalry that has taken over figure skatingThe question, inevitably, on the Yale campus this week as classes resumed was: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you get up to over spring break?\xe2\x80\x9d No one had an answer quite like Nathan Chen\xe2\x80\x99s. The American figure skater \xe2\x80\x93 and Yale freshman \xe2\x80\x93 traveled to Tokyo last week to capture his second consecutive world championship, this time triumphing over two-time Olympic gold medalist and Japanese hero Yuzuru Hanyu on home turf. While it\xe2\x80\x99s not Chen\xe2\x80\x99s first win over Hanyu, it is his biggest (Hanyu missed the worlds last year) and has many inside the sport believing that this is a rivalry that could build to \xe2\x80\x93 and explode at \xe2\x80\x93 the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnytime you have a rivalry, it\xe2\x80\x99s awesome for the sport,\xe2\x80\x9d says Todd Eldredge, the 1996 world champion and three-time Olympian. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like Boitano v Orser, or me and Elvis [Stojko]. There\xe2\x80\x99s always been two guys and then a bunch of other ones who are trying to knock you off of your pedestal. There is an excitement that comes with that.\xe2\x80\x9d Hanyu has had rivals in the past, such as Patrick Chan, and, more recently, Javier Fernandez. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the Japanese star who rose above each of them to win his respective Olympic golds in 2014 and 2018, earning the Greatest of All Time stamp from legions of skating fans. And while it was unclear if Hanyu will continue to skate beyond this season, the 24-year-old sounded as determined to continue the rivalry with Chen sat next to him during their press conference on Saturday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI am disappointed with the result, somewhat, being in second place,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cEven so, I\xe2\x80\x99m also very glad that I was able to compete with these two skaters [Chen and bronze medalist Vincent Zhou] and I want to thank them for making me feel that I want to become better now. I am determined to evolve \xe2\x80\xa6 and hopefully catch up as a skater one day.\xe2\x80\x9d The 19-year-old Chen, armed with a myriad of quadruple jumps, has passed Hanyu on the technical front, but also \xe2\x80\x93 with the help of famed choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne and his roots as a ballet dancer as a child \xe2\x80\x93 blossomed artistically. Hanyu, known to be one of the great artists in modern-day skating, edged Chen out by just 1.35 points in their components scores at worlds. Chen, however, won the event by 22.45 points. \xe2\x80\x9cNathan\xe2\x80\x99s [team] is smart, they\xe2\x80\x99re playing our game: it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about getting those technical points,\xe2\x80\x9d Hanyu\xe2\x80\x99s coach, the Olympic silver medalist Brian Orser, told the Olympic Channel. \xe2\x80\x9cHis skating skills have gotten better. We did the same thing when we were challenging and trying to compete with Patrick Chan. The thought was, \xe2\x80\x98How do we get ahead of Patrick?\xe2\x80\x99 With Nathan and Yuzuru, they\xe2\x80\x99re getting better because of each other. How long will this go on? I have no idea.\xe2\x80\x9d Chen, meanwhile, will return to the rigors of Yale, where he has said he\xe2\x80\x99ll focus his studies on pre-med. This semester includes an abnormal psychology class, and his training routine is executed alone, often with coach Rafael Arutunian watching on FaceTime \xe2\x80\xa6 3,000 miles away in southern California. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine taking on a full load of school and training away from your coach while trying to defend a world title,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eldredge. \xe2\x80\x9cFor him to keep his focus, it speaks to the kind of person he is.\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist, attended Harvard while training in Boston for part of his career. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to a place where you practice this incredibly demanding discipline and then are able to step back into the dining hall or classroom, it sort of normalizes you, it enables you to oscillate between the two,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wylie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re at a place life with a bunch of people who are striving for greatness in so many different ways. That place vibrates with so much energy and attention to detail. A lot of skaters sit out the college experience. I think they could learn something there, being surrounded with new ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d How Chen\xe2\x80\x99s college schedule changes as Beijing grows closer remains to be seen. In a way, being at Yale has helped lessen the pressure that contributed to his implosion \xe2\x80\x93 twice \xe2\x80\x93 at the Olympics last February. But that low was a learning experience. On Saturday night he skated immediately after Hanyu, with 20,000-plus Japanese fans roaring for their hero, showering the ice with his favorite stuffed toy, Winnie the Pooh. Chen didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. In fact, he was following it all off-ice on Twitter before taking his starting his routine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a huge honor just to be at this event with Yuzuru in Japan. I was fully expecting him to bring the house down and everyone to their feet and have this crazy atmosphere. They cheered for me as well \xe2\x80\x93 though a little bit less,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the reason I love skating so much.\xe2\x80\x9d Moments after Hanyu had set a world record free-skate score, Chen topped it. By nearly 10 points. A great rivalry could no doubt serve the sport well. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something the fans love to see,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wylie. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they are worthy rivals and can push each other to greatness. I\xe2\x80\x99m selfish\xe2\x80\xa6 I want to see it! They need it too: it keeps them going.\xe2\x80\x9d In the meantime, the rivalry has both Chen and Hanyu looking inward: Chen wants to bring back his quad Salchow, Hanyu the quad Lutz and flip, as well as the never-done-before quad axel. Chen is leaving that task to his rival. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone is going to do a quad axel it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be this guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Chen said, smiling and pointing to Hanyu, sitting feet away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not doing a quad axel anytime soon. There are a lot of things that I can improve. I really look forward to and am striving towards [improving]. There will never be the perfect performance, but I would like to come close to it.\xe2\x80\x9d And while Hanyu goes back to the drawing board, Chen goes back to class. Final exams begin on 2 May at Yale. And, world gold medal or not, he has some studying to do over the next few weeks. He does, after all, have to finish his freshman year of college.'

|b'Authorities at odds over claim Adelaide Oval staff told not to admit Aboriginal peopleBox office staff at the Adelaide Oval were reportedly directed to stop selling tickets to Aboriginal people while fans gathered before last year\xe2\x80\x99s Naidoc Week AFL match celebrating Indigenous culture. The box office and Oval management said a supervisor \xe2\x80\x9cmisinterpreted\xe2\x80\x9d an instruction from the police and security not to sell tickets to a specific group of people who were intoxicated and had been refused entry. However, the police said on Friday that they \xe2\x80\x9cat no time made any direction to the ticket sales employees about the sale of tickets\xe2\x80\x9d. Last July, the Adelaide Oval was hosting a curtain-raiser match between teams from Maralinga and the APY Lands, before the Naidoc Week game between Adelaide and Geelong. A woman who was employed by McArthur Management as a ticket seller was reported by the ABC as saying she was told to stop selling tickets to Aboriginal people and instead tell them the game was sold out. She told the ABC she followed the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s instructions and saw others do so, but felt \xe2\x80\x9csick to my stomach\xe2\x80\x9d, resigned the next day and notified the South Australian Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission was unable to act on a complaint lodged by someone other than a victim. Tanya Hosch, the AFL\xe2\x80\x99s general manager for inclusion and social policy, told Guardian Australia they found out about the incident only when contacted by the ABC last week. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously we are deeply concerned that this has occurred and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working further to make sure it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen again,\xe2\x80\x9d Hosch said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to properly understand where the system broke down, ensure that there are the proper safeguards in place to make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again and that people know the law and that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful to discriminate against people on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d There were conflicting claims of where the instruction to staff originated. A McArthur Management representative said the supervisor claimed to be acting on the instructions of South Australia police and security guards. The spokesman said the 50-year-old company condemned racism and was \xe2\x80\x9chorrified\xe2\x80\x9d by the report. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand police and an Adelaide Oval security guard asked a McArthur supervisor at a Ticketek box office not to sell tickets to certain people because they were intoxicated,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. Darren Chandler, general manager of operations at Adelaide Oval, said everyone was welcome at the ground and that they condemned discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cin any form\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is extremely disappointing that a supervisor in the ticketing office misinterpreted a message from police and didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow established protocols that would have clarified the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe apologise to anyone affected and have taken steps to ensure this situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t arise again.\xe2\x80\x9d South Australia police said officers responded to a call for assistance with patrons who \xe2\x80\x9cwere clearly intoxicated\xe2\x80\x9d and had been refused entry. \xe2\x80\x9cPolice at no time made any direction to the ticket sales employees about the sale of tickets.\xe2\x80\x9d John Paul Janke, co-chair of the national Naidoc committee, said it was alarming that in a workplace in 2019 no one pointed out that the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s instruction was illegal. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a lot of Aboriginal people it\xe2\x80\x99s just exhausting, having to put up with racism at every turn. And we\xe2\x80\x99re exhausted at having to call it out.\xe2\x80\x9d He said it was particularly disappointing that it occurred during a game that was \xe2\x80\x9cabout celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander achievement and culture and history\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the two teams that come down from remote areas \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s actually one of the biggest games on their footy calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Last month, Accor, the French multinational hotel company with thousands of hotels around the world, was forced to apologise after the ABC revealed its Alice Springs staff was segregating Aboriginal guests from non-Aboriginal guests into an inferior section of the Ibis Styles hotel, where the rooms were in poorer condition and frequently unclean. On Thursday, the company said the hotel had \xe2\x80\x9cfallen short\xe2\x80\x9d of the ethical standards it had set. It has also set up a customer care line (1300 085 356) for any guest who stayed at the hotel to raise concerns about how they were treated.'

|b'Far-right terrorism threat is growing, say MI5 and police chiefsFar-right terrorism has been identified as a key threat to the safety and prosperity of the country, according to the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, and Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Writing in the Times, the pair warned that while Islamist terrorism remains the largest by scale, they are also \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about the growing threat from other forms of violent extremism \xe2\x80\xa6 covering a spectrum of hate-driven ideologies, including the extreme right and left.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOver the past few years [police] have stopped a number of rightwing terrorist attacks from getting through,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. In the wake of the Christchurch attacks, in which 50 Muslims were killed by a suspected white supremacist, security services worldwide have refocused on the threat of far-right extremists. Sara Khan, the UK\xe2\x80\x99s lead anti-extremism commissioner, told the Observer this month there has been a surge of UK-based far-right activists who are \xe2\x80\x9corganised, professional and actively attempting to recruit\xe2\x80\x9d. Khan, who is preparing a report on extremism for the home secretary, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard deep concern about the far right and its devastating impact on individuals, communities and our democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d She also said that a \xe2\x80\x9cfrightening amount of legal extremist content online\xe2\x80\x9d was fuelling far-right activism. Elsewhere in their article, Parker and Dick said \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous plots\xe2\x80\x9d had been thwarted in the UK since terror attacks in 2017 in London and Manchester. After those attacks, the pair had commissioned Lord Anderson to write an independent review into them. The report highlighted three key themes: the need to counter violent groups on the extreme right and left; how the security services and the police use data; and the need for intelligence sharing at local level with other organisations. \xe2\x80\x9cOn data, we identified ways in which advances in that field enable us to sharpen our \xe2\x80\x98radar\xe2\x80\x99 and increase insight,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no magic solution but there are valuable gains to be made by going further in data analytics and related technologies with parts of the private sector. We have made important progress already.\xe2\x80\x9d The use of behavioural science will allow agencies to \xe2\x80\x9cdetect signs of developing intent\xe2\x80\x9d. Allied with information-sharing across multiple agencies, including social services, \xe2\x80\x9cthis approach to managing the risk in communities posed by individuals linked to violent extremism can succeed where a more active, intrusive investigation might not\xe2\x80\x9d. Several pilot projects are already running on this model, which could soon be rolled out across the UK. It is similar to how some authorities manage sexual and violent offenders.'

|b'Another year of the benefits freeze will be too much pain for many BritsNext month, a seemingly minor \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare\xe2\x80\x9d policy will come into force. You won\xe2\x80\x99t hear a chorus of MPs talking about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to make any newspaper front pages. But it will determine whether millions of families will have enough money to live on \xe2\x80\x93 and give a snapshot of what Brexit Britain is really going to look like. The benefits freeze \xe2\x80\x93 that Osbornomics pillar of post-crash \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare reform\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 has squeezed low-income families for the past three years: while rent, food and utility bills have shot up, many social security rates have been frozen. From April, the policy will enter its fourth year. This coincides with households facing price hikes to gas and electricity, council tax and water bills, and food banks rushing to stockpile supplies in preparation for a Brexit-dented economy. The result is simple and brutal: freezing benefits for another year means some of the poorest families in the country will become nearly \xc2\xa3900 poorer in 2019-20, according to the Resolution Foundation. In the real world, that means a single mum on a zero-hour contract facing eviction because her housing benefit won\xe2\x80\x99t stretch to cover the rent. Or an ex-teacher with Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s skipping meals because his out-of-work sickness benefits don\xe2\x80\x99t cover the cost of food. The scale of this is as big as it gets. Between 2016 and 2020, the benefit freeze will have swept 400,000 more people into poverty, and affected more than 27 million people. That includes 11 million children. The families about to be squeezed for another year are not starting off in a secure position: they have already endured nearly a decade of low wages, rising prices and benefit changes. They have no shield to survive another hit. That you are hearing barely a whisper from Westminster about this is not as bad as it gets. When pressed to comment this month, Philip Hammond actively defended his choice to maintain the freeze \xe2\x80\x93 even dragging out the old trope that such moves are necessary after previous Labour governments\xe2\x80\x99 high welfare spending. Notably, Hammond has found the cash for yet another tax cut for high earners, as well as \xc2\xa326bn of \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal headroom\xe2\x80\x9d until a Brexit deal is agreed. The choice to continue the benefits freeze is emblematic of a political class that has learned little from the past, and has few answers for where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading. It is \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d politics, all at a time when there has never been more pressing need for change. To watch parliament lurch between ever-poorer Brexit options this week is not so much reminiscent of captains rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic as of ones who are oblivious to the fact that the iceberg has already hit. The threat of an economic downturn post-Brexit is significant and deeply worrying, but much of the conversation around it ignores the fact that, for many, real hardship is already here. Swathes of families in Britain are living in an economy where they can\xe2\x80\x99t even afford the basics. Official figures released this week show that the number of children and pensioners in absolute poverty jumped in the last year, all at the same time as inequality rose. A decade of catastrophic cuts by George Osborne and his successor has left Britain on its knees: child poverty leaving kids unwashed and hungry; elderly and disabled people abandoned without social care; schools barely able to stay open all week, let alone nurture the next generation. To put it another way, the unspoken truth among the Brexit mayhem is that this is not a country that is preparing to launch itself into the abyss: it is one where millions have been expected to live in darkness for years. There is a reason why warnings of an economic downturn failed to register with some leave voters during the EU referendum campaign, and measures such as the benefit freeze will convince many that the status quo of approved inequality is here to stay. That the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Society recently found that the number of people awarded crisis support by the state has plummeted by 75% since the government cut funding and pushed the burden on to cash-strapped councils in 2013 is a symbol of where we currently find ourselves: a country that has not witnessed greater need in modern times but is seemingly devoid of any desire to meet it. No matter how Brexit itself concludes, the conditions that brought us here have not begun to be addressed, nor is there any proof the Britain that will emerge from the wreckage is one that struggling families can put their trust in. The fact that a \xe2\x80\x9ccaretaker prime minister\xe2\x80\x9d could be a necessity shows how rudderless and entirely without ambition much of our politics now is. Whether it is Brexit or years of austerity, if any of this is to mean anything, it is going to have to lead to some self-reflection from those at the top \xe2\x80\x93 call it a national reckoning about what sort of society we are going to be. It is the one question that no one in the parliamentary chaos appears to be asking \xe2\x80\x93 what next? Because lost among the talk of backstops and trade deals, this is a country that is crying out for social and economic change. As it is, we are all just frozen in time. \xe2\x80\xa2 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist \xe2\x80\xa2 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

already, here., swathes, of, families, in, britain, are, living, in, an, economy, where, they, can\xe2\x80\x99t, even, afford, the, basics., official, figures, released, this, week, show, that, the, number, of, children, and, pensioners, in, absolute, poverty, jumped, in, the, last, year,, all, at, the, same, time, as, inequality, rose., a, decade, of, catastrophic, cuts, by, george, osborne, and, his, successor, has, left, britain, on, its, knees:, child, poverty, leaving, kids, unwashed, and, hungry;, elderly, and, disabled, people, abandoned, without, social, care;, schools, barely, able, to, stay, open, all, week,, let, alone, nurture, the, next, generation., to, put, it, another, way,, the, unspoken, truth, among, the, brexit, mayhem, is, that, this, is, not, a, country, that, is, preparing, to, launch, itself, into, the, abyss:, it, is, one, where, millions, have, been, expected, to, live, in, darkness, for, years., there, is, a, reason, why, warnings, of, an, economic, downturn, failed, to, register, with, some, leave, voters, during, the, eu, referendum, campaign,, and, measures, such, as, the, benefit, freeze, will, convince, many, that, the, status, quo, of, approved, inequality, is, here, to, stay., that, the, children\xe2\x80\x99s, society, recently, found, that, the, number, of, people, awarded, crisis, support, by, the, state, has, plummeted, by, 75%, since, the, government, cut, funding, and, pushed, the, burden, on, to, cash-strapped, councils, in, 2013, is, a, symbol, of, where, we, currently, find, ourselves:, a, country, that, has, not, witnessed, greater, need, in, modern, times, but, is, seemingly, devoid, of, any, desire, to, meet, it., no, matter, how, brexit, itself, concludes,, the, conditions, that, brought, us, here, have, not, begun, to, be, addressed,, nor, is, there, any, proof, the, britain, that, will, emerge, from, the, wreckage, is, one, that, struggling, families, can, put, their, trust, in., the, fact, that, a, \xe2\x80\x9ccaretaker, prime, minister\xe2\x80\x9d, could, be, a, necessity, shows, how, rudderless, and, entirely, without, ambition, much, of, our, politics, now, is., whether, it, is, brexit, or, years, of, austerity,, if, any, of, this, is, to, mean, anything,, it, is, going, to, have, to, lead, to, some, self-reflection, from, those, at, the, top, \xe2\x80\x93, call, it, a, national, reckoning, about, what, sort, of, society, we, are, going, to, be., it, is, the, one, question, that, no, one, in, the, parliamentary, chaos, appears, to, be, asking, \xe2\x80\x93, what, next?, because, lost, among, the, talk, of, backstops, and, trade, deals,, this, is, a, country, that, is, crying, out, for, social, and, economic, change., as, it, is,, we, are, all, just, frozen, in,

|b'The Other Americans by Laila Lalami review \xe2\x80\x93 the political is personalWith the notable exception of the Japanese Americans interned in camps after Pearl Harbor, US civilians were remarkably well insulated from the shock of 20th-century war. In the 21st century the nature of war changed. Since 9/11, American security forces have been occupied with preventing foreign operatives from bringing conflicts to US cities. Migration has changed the population of many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s nations. Citizens of America may share a language, a faith and a heritage with the enemy overseas. Nowadays wars do not stay in their place; rather, the ricochet of bullets fired in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan echoes through the streets of small-town America. This is the starting point of Laila Lalami\xe2\x80\x99s new novel. Her previous novel, The Moor\xe2\x80\x99s Account, was nominated for both a Pulitzer prize and the Man Booker. It tells the story of the Castilian P\xc3\xa1nfilo de Narv\xc3\xa1ez, who sailed to the Americas in 1527; his voyage and its brutal aftermath are seen from the perspective of Estebanico, a Moroccan slave. Where The Moor\xe2\x80\x99s Account is stately in tone and sweeping in scope, focusing on conquest and survival, The Other Americans is set entirely in one small California town and its environs and is concerned with the intimacies of relationships between neighbours, former classmates and family members. What both books share, however, is a concern with the effects of violence on the human psyche. The story begins with a late-night hit-and-run on an empty street. The victim is Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant and restaurant owner. There are no witnesses, or so it at first appears. In fact, there is one: Efra\xc3\xadn Aceves, whose undocumented status and consequent fear of deportation stop him coming forward and make him resist the urgings of his wife to do the right thing. The novel is told from multiple viewpoints: Nora, Driss\xe2\x80\x99s composer daughter; Jeremy Gorecki, an Iraq veteran and Nora\xe2\x80\x99s former classmate; Erica Coleman, the newly arrived police detective investigating the killing; Anderson Baker, a bowling alley proprietor who owns the property adjacent to the family\xe2\x80\x99s diner; the widowed Maryam Guerraoui; and even the deceased Driss himself. The multiple voices are handled with restrained mastery by Lalami, who eschews drama to focus on nuance and detail, offering an ever-shifting perspective on events. The many strands of the novel are held together by the unfolding murder investigation. Could what looks like an accident possibly be a hate crime? There are sufficient tensions to offer possibilities but nothing that quite looks like a motive. Lalami brilliantly underplays the rising pressure in this simmering desert town as Nora\xe2\x80\x99s questioning reveals a history of resentment between her father and his neighbour, who had wanted to buy the Guerraoui property, as well as secrets her father hid from his own family. Nora\xe2\x80\x99s increasing frustration with the pace of the police inquiry is set against the methodical and unhurried approach of Detective Coleman, an African American woman. In the hands of another writer, these details would be foregrounded, but Lalami resists the obvious. Coleman is worried about her son\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make friends in their new home. Ethnicity, gender \xe2\x80\x93 these things don\xe2\x80\x99t matter until they matter. New grievances have a way of following old fault lines. There lies at the heart of The Other Americans a cautionary tale for those who claim politics has no place in their lives, and that includes a great many Americans. Acts of brutality, even those distant in time and geography, cast a shadow over relationships between the town\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants. Nora\xe2\x80\x99s growing intimacy with Iraq vet Jeremy is clouded by his memories of wartime atrocities and the presence, by turns disturbing and needy, of his Marine buddy Fierro. The threat of political violence that drove Nora\xe2\x80\x99s parents to leave Morocco is given expression in Maryam\xe2\x80\x99s quiet melancholy, her regret at losing her homeland, and in her elder daughter\xe2\x80\x99s duty-bound frustration. Turning the \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d into scapegoats for personal failure gives rise in turn to new acts of violence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe present could never be untethered from the past, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand one without the other,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Coleman as she comes to comprehend the interplay between the town\xe2\x80\x99s residents. The Other Americans demonstrates brilliantly, in ways foreseen and unforeseen, as often denied as acknowledged, how the personal and political enmesh in all our lives. \xe2\x80\xa2 The Other Americans is published by Bloomsbury Circus (\xc2\xa316.99).

|b'Brexit: Theresa May tries to buy time for deal as MPs call on her to leaveTheresa May will put only half of her Brexit deal to a vote on Friday, in a final desperate attempt to secure MPs\xe2\x80\x99 support as senior cabinet ministers made clear she must leave No 10 very soon, whatever happens. On the day Britain was originally meant to leave the EU \xe2\x80\x93 something May had promised would happen more than 100 times \xe2\x80\x93 the prime minister will put only the withdrawal agreement to a vote, having promised to step aside if the MPs give her their approval. No 10 is hoping that some Labour MPs could back the withdrawal agreement severing the UK\xe2\x80\x99s membership of the EU, without the political declaration governing Britain\xe2\x80\x99s future relationship with Brussels. However, it remains extremely unlikely to pass as Labour said it would never vote for a \xe2\x80\x9cblindfold Brexit\xe2\x80\x9d, while around 30 Eurosceptic Tories and the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs are also holding out against it. MPs will be warned that failure to back the withdrawal agreement this time will lead to a long extension that requires participation in European parliament elections or crashing out without a deal on 12 April. MPs who support a soft Brexit are meanwhile working on a new round of votes on the alternatives on Monday, including a compromise that could combine the support of those MPs who voted for a customs union, for Labour\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit plan and for the Norway-style option dubbed \xe2\x80\x9ccommon market 2.0\xe2\x80\x9d. With European leaders sceptical that such efforts will be successful, the EU\xe2\x80\x99s chief negotiator Michel Barnier told diplomats on Thursday that a no deal was now \xe2\x80\x9cthe most plausible outcome\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered work to begin on wargaming the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s response. No 10 insists that it can still make progress, arguing that passing the withdrawal agreement alone will allow the UK to avoid a cliff-edge Brexit on 12 April and secure another five weeks to renegotiate the political declaration in order win support for the deal in its entirety. This is because the EU has said the UK will have to leave on 12 April if no deal is passed, but would grant an extension to 22 May if the withdrawal agreement goes through. But Labour has repeatedly said it is opposed to this plan. After Jeremy Corbyn held a 20-minute call with the prime minister, a spokesperson said: \xe2\x80\x9cJeremy made clear Labour will not agree a blindfold Brexit to force through Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s damaging deal, which would leave the next Tory party leader free to rip up essential rights and protections and undermine jobs and living standards.\xe2\x80\x9d With the deal looking all but dead without the support of the DUP, there are fears among some ministers and MPs that May could try to cling on and put her deal to the country in a general election if it does not win support. They worry that a futile version of the withdrawal deal is being put to MPs in order for the Conservatives to say at an election that Labour refused to pass even the most basic part of the agreement to leave the EU. MPs believe some of May\xe2\x80\x99s advisers are pushing the option of an election, but cabinet sources have told the Guardian this option would not be acceptable and that the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s position was the same whether or not she gets her deal through. One cabinet minister told the Guardian: \xe2\x80\x9cNow the prime minister has said she is going, there is no point in hanging around indefinitely having said that.\xe2\x80\x9d The minister also poured cold water on claims that there will be a general election, pointing to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is pre-2010 speak. It is not in the PM\xe2\x80\x99s gift to decide that there is a general election. It is in parliament\xe2\x80\x99s gift. I doubt there is a majority in parliament for holding a general election.\xe2\x80\x9d Another cabinet source said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow she has said she is going, she will have to go whether she gets the deal through next week or not, and will have to set a timetable. No one can say this publicly because she still commands some sympathy. But there is no point waiting when power is draining away.\xe2\x80\x9d A source in one of the leadership campaigns to replace May also said: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has got to go regardless. She has fired the starting gun and there is no going back. She cannot carry on and have an election. All her credibility is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d The deadlock in parliament has led many to believe that a general election is increasingly likely but there would be pressure from many MPs to make sure a new leader is in place before any contest is called. MPs have been called in on Friday, which was meant to be a non-sitting day, in order to vote on the Withdrawal Act. But even No 10 does not appear confident of it passing, given that talks with the DUP appeared to have been shelved on Thursday. It also acknowledges that the UK cannot legally leave the EU without getting approval from MPs for both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Making the case for the vote, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the house listens to the rationale behind it, when it hears the full context of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the house will accept it is not only perfectly lawful, perfectly sensible and is designed to give this house an opportunity of availing itself of a right the European Union has given to us to avail ourselves of an extension until 22 May. \xe2\x80\x9cThe view of the government is simply we could not let the time limit expire at 11pm tomorrow, of allowing this house the opportunity of availing itself of that right. It is perfectly reasonable and it is perfectly lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d May\xe2\x80\x99s de facto deputy, David Lidington, also urged MPs to back the withdrawal agreement irrespective of their opinions about the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you believe in delivering the referendum result by leaving the EU with a deal then it is necessary to back the withdrawal agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the British Chambers of Commerce conference in London. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether a particular MP wants the final destination to look like Norway or look like Canada or look like the proposals in the Chequers white paper, the starting point is the withdrawal agreement itself.\xe2\x80\x9d But Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, warned his party\xe2\x80\x99s own MPs not to fall for the government\xe2\x80\x99s pleas to back the withdrawal agreement only, saying the likely Tory leadership contest meant it could be a \xe2\x80\x9cBoris Johnson Brexit, a Jacob Rees-Mogg Brexit, or a Michael Gove Brexit\xe2\x80\x9d. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the prime minister tries to separate the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration altogether, that only makes matters worse. We would be leaving the EU, but with absolutely no idea where we are heading. That cannot be acceptable and Labour will not vote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
