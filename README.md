# PySparkStreaming-MultiNewsClassification
The Program trains a pyspark MLLib Pipeline model with Tokenizer, stop word remover, Labialize, TF-IDF, vectorizer and two classifiers i.e. Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes. Then it compares result of both classifier(Logistic and Naïve Bayes) on spark streaming data for multiple news type classification.
