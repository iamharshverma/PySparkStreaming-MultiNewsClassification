0,b'Watson,"b'Watson: if Labour backs another referendum it can beat Tories in electionsLabour\xe2\x80\x99s deputy leader Tom Watson has called on his party to \xe2\x80\x9cembrace\xe2\x80\x9d European elections in May, as well as the possibility of a general election, saying that if it goes into either contest pledging a confirmatory referendum it can beat the Tories. His upbeat pre-election rallying call comes as MPs prepare to vote again on Monday on a second referendum, after the plan to hold one on any Brexit deal that passes through parliament won the most votes of any option considered by MPs in last Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s series of indicative votes. Writing on theguardian.com, Watson says he is gearing up local members to select Labour candidates ready for the elections. While he emphasises his respect for Labour MPs and members opposed to a referendum, he says the party has now come together on a policy \xe2\x80\x9cthat can unite our members, voters, MPs and yes, the leadership too.\xe2\x80\x9d Referring to Labour commitment to a policy under which any deal would have to be confirmed in a people\xe2\x80\x99s vote he says: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a compromise position that provides a clear path to break the deadlock. Whether you voted leave, like the majority of people in my area did, or whether you voted remain, the current parliamentary paralysis works for no one. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now have until April 12th to either agree a new path to a viable Brexit deal, with an extension to Article 50 that means taking part in European elections, or crash out with no deal. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Labour should embrace European elections just as we should welcome a general election that might get rid of this broken government. If we go into either contest with a positive policy on Brexit and say any final deal must be put back to the people, I am confident Labour can win. We already have a fund raised by local parties to pay for the campaign and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked our national executive committee to develop a plan to get grassroots members involved in selecting candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d While supporters of a second referendum accept that the idea may not win majority support in the House of Commons on Monday, they believe it could still do so when tabled in the form of an amendment to any motion to approve a deal, or to legislation that will be needed to implement any withdrawal agreement. Under the plan to be voted on Monday, drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, MPs would vote for a Brexit deal conditional on it then going to the country for a public vote, with Remain being the alternative on the ballot paper. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s comments come as leading Remainers in parliament are increasingly eyeing the European elections as an opportunity to mobilise those who want a public vote in order to keep the UK in the EU, following the march by one million people in support of a referendum last weekend. He says Tory supporters, MPs and ministers, are fearful of European elections. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tories are right to be frightened of elections. Their internal war over Europe, waged for the last 30 years, has led the country to this point. They\xe2\x80\x99ve messed up Brexit which has gone from chaos to national humiliation and are completely incapable of providing the leadership we need.\xe2\x80\x9d By contrast Labour should relish them. \xe2\x80\x9cOur values have always been internationalist and outward-looking. The biggest gains we made in 2017 were among young people who share those values and want to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild bridges not walls\xe2\x80\x9d. It falls to Labour to develop a modern programme of change to address the root causes of why 52% voted for Brexit.\xe2\x80\x9d His intervention comes as the latest Opinium poll for the Observer reveals the Tories have lost their small lead over Labour amid the Brexit chaos. Labour and the Tories are now neck-and-neck on 35% of the vote. Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s lead over Jeremy Corbyn, when voters are asked who would be the best prime minister, has halved since last month. Her lead has dropped from 15 points at the end of February to 7 points in the latest poll. Both leaders continue to meet with deep disapproval over their handling of Brexit. Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s net approval ratings on Brexit continue to slide, hitting an all-time low of minus 53%, with 14% approving and 67% disapproving. Perception of Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s handling of Brexit has improved slightly since last week. She now has a net approval on Brexit of minus 38%, with 23% approving and 61% disapproving. In the event of May resigning, Boris Johnson was the only leading candidate who had a lead over Corbyn when voters were asked which would make the best prime minister, with 25% backing Johnson and 24% backing the Labour leader. Adam Drummond, from Opinium, said: \xe2\x80\x9cNeither party leader gets good marks in terms of their overall approval rating or how voters think they have handled Brexit and, on the question of who would be the best prime minister, \xe2\x80\x98none of these\xe2\x80\x99 is rapidly approaching 50%. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lack of enthusiasm extends to Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s possible replacements as well. Boris Johnson is the only potential Tory leader we tested who beats Jeremy Corbyn on the \xe2\x80\x98best prime minister\xe2\x80\x99 question (albeit by 1%).\xe2\x80\x9d Opinium polled 2,008 adults online between 28 March and 29 March.'"

The incident happened in round five when Price, 35, landed a fierce blow on the 27-year-old previously undefeated Birmingham fighter. Ali reacted by forcing his former sparring partner to the canvas where he was seen to bite the Liverpudlian, leaving a clearly visible mark on his torso. The referee, Mark Lyson, who had earlier docked Ali a point for hitting the back of Price\xe2\x80\x99s head, immediately disqualified him and awarded the victory to Price, who had been ahead on the scorecards. Ali left the M&amp;S Bank Arena under a barrage of drinks thrown by spectators. Before the fight Ali had vowed to \xe2\x80\x9cspark out\xe2\x80\x9d Price in front of his home crowd, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my time to show all the boxing people that I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to mess about. Beating someone like David will put me straight in the mix. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity to show my skills, and show that I\xe2\x80\x99m a real contender. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m younger, I\xe2\x80\x99m fresher. I\xe2\x80\x99m made for this. This is my first chance on the big stage and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make it count \xe2\x80\xa6 There could be 10 of him in the ring and I\xe2\x80\x99d go through every single one. He\xe2\x80\x99s always been a quitter. He\xe2\x80\x99s quit before and he\xe2\x80\x99ll quit again. I\xe2\x80\x99m ending his career.\xe2\x80\x9d After being awarded the win, Price, who claimed he had been bitten more than once, said Ali had asked for a rematch \xe2\x80\x93 a request he had refused. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to share the ring again with an animal like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did a couple early on and I thought he had lost his head completely. I hurt him to the body just before the final bite he took.\xe2\x80\x9d The former world cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew told Sky Sports that Ali was \xe2\x80\x9ca disgrace \xe2\x80\xa6 he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed back in a boxing ring ever again. \xe2\x80\x9cHe should not be paid for the fight \xe2\x80\x93 give the money to grassroots boxing and help develop amateur boxing.

2,b'Honours system under scrutiny after sex abuser kept title for yearsLawyers have called for an overhaul of the honours forfeiture system after it emerged that a sex abuser retained an honour bestowed for services to the Queen some three years after a court recognised him as a paedophile,"b'Honours system under scrutiny after sex abuser kept title for yearsLawyers have called for an overhaul of the honours forfeiture system after it emerged that a sex abuser retained an honour bestowed for services to the Queen some three years after a court recognised him as a paedophile. The system is too slow to acknowledge an offender\xe2\x80\x99s offences, say lawyers specialising in abuse claims, and, in the case of those who have died, cannot strip them of their honours, leaving victims feeling that they have been cheated of justice. Hubert Chesshyre, 78, an expert on heraldry and genealogy, held a number of senior positions within the royal household, rising to become secretary of the most noble order of the garter, the highest order in British chivalry. Among the many honours bestowed upon him over more than 40 years were the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Silver and Golden Jubilee Medals, and the commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) \xe2\x80\x93 the latter for distinguished personal service to the monarch. A fellow or member of several illustrious organisations and charities, he was a heraldic consultant to the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Lord Sugar and Sir Terry Pratchett. But it recently emerged during the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) that in 2015 Chesshyre was found to have sexually abused a teenage chorister during the 1990s, a fact that has remained buried from public record. This is because Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s case did not result in a criminal conviction. Rather, the inquiry heard \xe2\x80\x9che was found to have committed the acts in question\xe2\x80\x9d in a trial of the facts. These are held when the accused is deemed unfit to plead. The court recognised that Chesshyre had suffered a stroke. It was also said that he had dementia. As a result, despite being found to have committed the abuse, he was given an absolute discharge. The fact that Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s name was misspelled throughout the trial, despite repeated police efforts to have it corrected, has made it difficult to identify him in legal databases. His victim told the Observer that he believed there may have been others. \xe2\x80\x9cI know of other boys from the choir where their parents became concerned and stopped Mr Chesshyre from having anything more to do with them.\xe2\x80\x9d Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s case is similar to that of Lord Janner, who was also accused of sexual abuse. Suffering from dementia, Janner was due to undergo a similar trial of the facts but this was dropped after his death in 2015. In October 2015, Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s victim wrote to Sir Alan Reid, secretary of the Royal Victorian Order, calling for forfeiture of Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s honour. Reid replied that this would be wrong because Chesshyre had been given an absolute discharge, and no conviction registered. Reid\xe2\x80\x99s position was mirrored by that of several organisations. The Heraldry Society said that it had no plans to remove his fellowship, in an email seen by the Observer. In another email to the victim, the Society of Antiquaries of London said it would not put the question of his removal to the fellows of the society. The Bach Choir said it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot incumbent\xe2\x80\x9d on it to take any further action as Chesshyre, an associate member, had no involvement with it any more. The Corporation of London emailed the victim to tell him it did not have the power to remove Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s status as a Freeman of the City of London. The Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies continues to list Hubert Chesshyre CVO as a vice-president. It was only after the victim contacted his MP, who took it up with the prime minister, that the honour was eventually forefeited. But the victim only learned of this action in October 2018, five months after it happened and three years after Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s trial. He was dismayed to learn via a Cabinet Office email that the forefeiture would not be published in the London Gazette, a standard procedure. The case has led to calls for the honours forfeiture system to be reformed, an issue recently discussed at the IICSA. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant overhaul is necessary to ensure that any person who has been found to have committed acts of abuse on children has any and all honorific titles automatically removed, whether or not they are still alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Lord, abuse solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day. \xe2\x80\x9cSurvivors of abuse deserve to be safe in the knowledge that when crimes committed against them are proven, any benefits or prestige conveyed to the holder of an honorary title are swiftly removed in a clear and transparent process.\xe2\x80\x9d As of Saturday night, Chesshyre\xe2\x80\x99s Wikipedia page made no mention of his trial. When approached by the Observer, the various societies of which he is a member confirmed that they would not be dissociating themselves from him. The victim said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as most people are concerned, he\xe2\x80\x99s still Hubert Chesshyre CVO.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
3,b'J,"b'J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp piles praise on Spurs and Pochettino before Anfield clashThis is supposed to be the business end of the season, squeaky-bum time in terms of the title race, yet Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Anfield on Sunday afternoon may turn out to be more of a love-in than a leadership contest. For one thing, games between the two clubs in recent seasons have featured exquisite goals, open football and marvellous entertainment. For another, J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp makes no secret of his admiration for Spurs, their manager and their leading scorer, even if they do arrive on Merseyside looking for their first Premier League win in more than a month. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can expect a strong Tottenham, they are a world-class team,\xe2\x80\x9d the Liverpool manager says. \xe2\x80\x9cIn England, the country of transfers, it makes a pretty big statement when you don\xe2\x80\x99t sign anyone at all, but in a way I could see why Mauricio Pochettino did that, why they were not too concerned last summer when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring in any new players. \xe2\x80\x9cMauricio is just a brilliant coach and his team is really good already. Now the players have a lot more experience of playing together, of finding solutions to different problems, and that makes them a really tough opponent.\xe2\x80\x9d Not many Premier League managers would admit this of a rival but Klopp even confesses to enjoying doing his homework on Spurs, taking pleasure in watching videos of their games. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes analysing opponents is a joy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is pretty easy to sit down and view Spurs games if you like watching good football. Even if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t won their last few games they always manage to come up with good moments, in fact sometimes they have so many good moments it is hard to work out how they lost the game.\xe2\x80\x9d A cynic might suspect Klopp of attempting to pressure Tottenham by bigging them up so much, possibly hoping to build an air of false confidence, though the Liverpool manager has rarely been one for mind games and his respect for Harry Kane, in particular, appears genuine. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a striker!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaims. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a really difficult opponent to look after and, as with all world-class players, you cannot afford to just concentrate on him. Do that and Christian Eriksen will be shooting from 50 yards out or something, Dele Alli will be getting headers in the box or Son Heung-min will be running in from behind. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of what I like about Spurs, they have so many different attacking options, and if nothing works they can bring on a player like \xc3\x89rik Lamela to see what he can do. They have unbelievable quality right through the team, an outstanding goalkeeper, full-backs that can give you many different opportunities, fantastic centre-backs and a great midfield. Then you come to the front line.\xe2\x80\x9d Good as Son, Alli and Eriksen undoubtedly are, it is clear Klopp has been following Kane\xe2\x80\x99s career quite closely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive as a ready-made player, a talented 18-year-old with everything at his feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Klopp says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had to work hard to get noticed and keep working to improve his game. I really like him for the way he went about building his career, he is a bit like Jamie Vardy in that respect; in fact, I have seen a photograph of them both together on the Leicester bench when Harry was on loan in the Championship. Fancy that, Kane and Vardy both on the same bench. The thought that struck me, I must admit, was that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be that [Leicester] manager.\xe2\x80\x9d Both Vardy and Kane have scored important goals against Liverpool in the past, and Klopp is evidently fond of the idea that not every effective Premier League striker has to cost a fortune. Yet surely it is a bit rich for a manager who spent \xc2\xa375m on Virgil van Dijk and became frustrated at Bayern Munich buying up all the talent in Germany to label England as the country of the transfer. \xe2\x80\x9cGermany is becoming the same, I think, but at least in Germany if you sign a player on a free transfer you still get a pat on the back,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cHere in England you are told it is no value. That\xe2\x80\x99s the big difference, that and transfer deadline day. That is so much bigger in this country than anywhere else, but there is more money here so it is more interesting to watch. \xe2\x80\x9cThis week when Bayern Munich signed Lucas Hernandez for \xc2\xa368m the manager of Hannover said that figure would cover his club\xe2\x80\x99s entire budget for a season. That is the football world we live in, it does not work for everyone but I think in England you still love the big numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d This season\xe2\x80\x99s title race could come down to quite small numbers, even goal difference in the end, though Klopp will not be instructing his players to double their scoring rate just in case. \xe2\x80\x9cYou score when you score, I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the boys to go out there and score six because it is disrespectful,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy if we just score the first goal and then the second. \xe2\x80\x9cWe score quite a lot of goals, anyway. People say it is not the same football as last year but we have not lost a lot of games. We have not been punched in the face yet like we were in Kiev, Basel or wherever in the last couple of years, but we have had a few difficult moments and tried to overcome them. That\xe2\x80\x99s all you can do really. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had any problems this season we might have had a couple more points, but it is very hard to go through a season without major problems. City came close last season but that was exceptional. No one likes dropping points but you have to learn from it and go again. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we try to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
3,b'Son Heung,"b'Son Heung-min: \xe2\x80\x98I miss White Hart Lane but the new stadium is amazing\xe2\x80\x99Son Heung-min has never known anything like it. Not since his arrival at Tottenham in August 2015 have the team endured a worse run of Premier League form during a single season. And, by the forward\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning, he has never gone three weeks without a match inside a domestic campaign. Seismic change is also afoot. After all the delays, Spurs are primed to enter their 62,062-capacity new stadium on Wednesday for the Premier League fixture with Crystal Palace. Son and his teammates trained there for the first time on Thursday and, it is fair to say, they are champing at the bit to perform in front of a full house. The atmosphere against Palace promises to be special. For Son, it is a time to reset. The defeat at Southampton on 9 March seems a long time ago and, since then, Son has been on a four\xe2\x80\x91day training break to Barcelona with his teammates, had a rare weekend off \xe2\x80\x93 because of Spurs being out of the FA Cup \xe2\x80\x93 and played the 90 minutes for South Korea in home wins over Bolivia and Colombia. He was up against his clubmate Davinson S\xc3\xa1nchez in the second, when he scored. He got back to London on Wednesday after a 12-hour flight. The Southampton loss continues to burn, particularly as it was a third in four league games, to follow those at Burnley and Chelsea. The other result in the sequence was the draw against Arsenal at Wembley \xe2\x80\x93 the club\xe2\x80\x99s temporary home since the start of last season \xe2\x80\x93 which could so easily have been a defeat. The downturn is untimely, to say the least. Spurs have felt their grip on a top-four finish loosen and, with stadium debts to repay, the importance of Champions League qualification and revenues has never been greater. The pressure is on for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Liverpool yet Son has a good feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had three weeks with no [club] games in my career \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s strange, very weird in a season \xe2\x80\x93 although the time has been very important for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Son says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to be mentally free. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at Tottenham for nearly four years and the last games we\xe2\x80\x99ve had \xe2\x80\x93 of course it was a surprise because we never had this situation. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we have to keep together and, after these three weeks, I hope we can be fresh and positive and energetic on the pitch. We want to be in the top four and we want to play Champions League with this amazing stadium. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident with my team. We can do it. We just need to believe in ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Son admits he felt a pang of nostalgia when he trained at the new ground, which stands on the site of Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 home since 1899. It might be added that some of his teammates believe that, despite the upsizing, it has retained the feel of White Hart Lane. But Son\xe2\x80\x99s theme of fresh beginnings applies equally to the stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel a bit different because I still remember White Hart Lane \xe2\x80\x93 when you come in, you\xe2\x80\x99re still thinking about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Son says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was young, I watched White Hart Lane. It\xe2\x80\x99s in my head. They\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the building and so for me [he exhales] \xe2\x80\xa6 crazy things. The Tottenham of White Hart Lane was a special thing but now we have to make history with the new stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I miss White Hart Lane but the new stadium is amazing \xe2\x80\x93 the pitch, the view, the stands; it\xe2\x80\x99s just unbelievable. Finally we are coming back home and it\xe2\x80\x99s great to be here again with the fans. They were tired, as well, with Wembley. Of course, Wembley is a very nice stadium but it\xe2\x80\x99s not actually our home. I think the fans are very happy, like us. The most important thing now is our performances in the new stadium.\xe2\x80\x9d After Palace, Spurs have the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City \xe2\x80\x93 either side of a home league fixture with Huddersfield \xe2\x80\x93 and Son would rather have drawn opposition from mainland Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play against an English team,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like a European game.\xe2\x80\x9d For three months from mid-November, Son\xe2\x80\x99s form for Spurs was so hot that he came to be a part of the player-of-the-year conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very unfair if I get this award because there are [other] players playing very well this season,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, with typical humility. Son is more comfortable talking about the impact Mauricio Pochettino has had on his career. The Spurs manager convinced him not to leave after a difficult first season and he has worked to improve his movement and awareness, among other things. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bit different between when you\xe2\x80\x99re playing and when you see from outside the pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Son says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gaffer sees every single action. If you move to that space; if I get the ball or other players get the ball and you make the space \xe2\x80\x93 these are the small details that have been very important. Without him, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be like this.\xe2\x80\x9d Son describes Pochettino as the best manager in the world and, with Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 stadium complete, he feels they have the infrastructure to rival that of any club. To Son\xe2\x80\x99s mind, it is now over to the players. The responsibility belongs to them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the best training ground in the world, we have the best stadium in the world and everything is ready to compare to anything. The answer is now with the players, how they perform. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important the players are serious and take the chance. I am looking to the future and winning something with this new stadium and with this unbelievable club.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
0,b'\xe2,"b'\xe2\x80\x98One Nation\xe2\x80\x99 Tories form group to counter pro-Brexit leadership candidatesDozens of moderate Tories, including senior cabinet ministers, have signed up to a powerful new party group in an attempt to stop the Conservatives lurching further to the right during the race to replace Theresa May. Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, already a key figure in the search for May\xe2\x80\x99s successor, is one of the leaders of the newly formed One Nation Group, said to comprise 40 MPs desperate to find a candidate committed to blocking a no-deal Brexit. The move comes as MPs, including some in government, warn that they believe entryism by pro-Brexit supporters at local Conservative associations risks delivering a leader willing to back a hard break with the EU. And it follows an outcry after Dominic Grieve, the pro-Remain former attorney general, lost a confidence vote held by his local party. Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove \xe2\x80\x93 who all campaigned to leave the EU \xe2\x80\x93 are among the four frontrunners. The fourth is foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the referendum but has since backed taking a hard line in EU negotiations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to learn the lessons of last time, where our wing was not organised and did not have enough say,\xe2\x80\x9d said one insider. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time we want to have influence to ensure we act as a caucus that can back someone who supports our kind of agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d Alongside Rudd, fellow cabinet ministers Greg Clark, David Gauke and David Mundell are understood to be backing the group. Also involved are energy minister Claire Perry, health minister Stephen Hammond and rising stars Rory Stewart and Bim Afolami. Rudd will sit on the group\xe2\x80\x99s board, alongside former ministers Damian Green, Nicky Morgan and veteran MP Nicholas Soames. The group was formed after a series of secret meetings and dinners held by MPs worried that the party was losing its sense of \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate Conservatism\xe2\x80\x9d. The One Nation Group is aiming to host hustings in a leadership contest. Candidates looking for their support will need to have been clearly against a no-deal Brexit. Several Tory MPs are comparing the leadership race to the Grand National, as so many names are being discussed. The comparison is not meant to be favourable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem with the Grand National is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a real danger the 80-1 knacker comes home,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. Another MP observed: \xe2\x80\x9cQuality horses go to Cheltenham. The nags go to Aintree.\xe2\x80\x9d The setting up of the One Nation Group confirms Rudd\xe2\x80\x99s status as a key power broker in the leadership race, but she has not ruled out running herself. Other MPs on the party\xe2\x80\x99s modernising wing want the group to throw its weight behind health secretary Matt Hancock, a close ally of George Osborne who has managed to steer clear of the Brexit debate. He is being touted as the \xe2\x80\x9cfresh start\xe2\x80\x9d candidate. Some long-term Tory donors, put off by pro-Brexit candidates, are keen to see Hancock in the race. Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary at the end of last year, is also regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9cchange candidate\xe2\x80\x9d for MPs alienated by Johnson. Gove is being touted as the best person to hammer out a trade deal with the EU and has earned respect among some MPs for sticking by May. However, he is now disliked by hardline Brexiters furious that he backed May\xe2\x80\x99s deal. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary and former chief whip, has emerged as the other key power broker. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting Gavin is a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said one source close to a leadership contender. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the whip. Whoever secures him will have a big chance.\xe2\x80\x9d However, Williamson has not ruled out a leadership bid himself. Justine Greening, the former education secretary, who backs a second referendum, is also considering a bid, and a number of young MPs are weighing up their chances. Under party rules, MPs will whittle the number of candidates down to two, and party members will then choose between them. There is now a real concern among mainstream MPs that a radicalised membership will simply select the most hardline candidate. \xe2\x80\x9cThe party will deny that our membership has become more extreme, but it has \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d said one member of the government. \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger is if we put up Hunt against Johnson or Raab, they will go for Johnson or Raab.\xe2\x80\x9d These concerns were heightened by the confidence vote against Grieve last Friday evening, at a meeting that saw him subjected to boos and jeers. Yesterday Grieve blamed a former Ukip opponent for orchestrating the vote against him. In his well-to-do Buckinghamshire constituency of Beaconsfield, residents were split on his future. Tom, a Tory member in his 70s who was at Friday\xe2\x80\x99s party meeting, said there had been a group of \xe2\x80\x9cloudmouthed yobs\xe2\x80\x9d present. He said he had joined the Conservatives six months ago \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I could see the danger that the lunatic fringe would displace Dominic Grieve, and it looks as though that could happen\xe2\x80\x9d. He said Grieve was an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary MP\xe2\x80\x9d and it was very sad that \xe2\x80\x9ca man like that should potentially be lost to the government or parliament because of blind prejudice by obsessive Brexiteers\xe2\x80\x9d. Alina, 42 and not a Tory supporter, added: \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciated the fact that he had a spine and was one of the very few people in parliament who understood how it worked, and he has integrity.\xe2\x80\x9d She said he knew the consequences of what he was going to do, \xe2\x80\x9cbut still did it\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d vote for him as a Tory, but if he ran as an independent that would be a different story,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Steve, shopping at Waitrose, called the vote against Grieve \xe2\x80\x9cfucking brilliant\xe2\x80\x9d. The 67-year-old said he had always voted for Grieve. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the major parties stood on manifestos that promised to abide by the [EU referendum] result, and he has continued to defy it. He\xe2\x80\x99s not fit for office. I am happy to see the back of him. I went to the Conservative office myself to see if there was anything I could do to make that happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
3,b'Careful Huddersfield pay inevitable price but are set up to returnAnd so Huddersfield,"b'Careful Huddersfield pay inevitable price but are set up to returnAnd so Huddersfield\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League journey nears the end that has long been signposted, via a sequence of results that reads like a faux-Welsh train station: LLDDLLLDLLWDWLLLLLLLLDLLLLLWLLLL. The No Limits hashtag and flags can be retired, as the two words that became the club\xe2\x80\x99s de facto motto during their sensational rise from the depths of the Championship no longer apply. Huddersfield have hit the buffers. They have been on a hell of a ride. It all became a bit joyless in recent months but a generation of fans leave the Premier League with memories that will last for ever: from the day promotion was sealed in the play-off final at Wembley in 2017 through to the victory over Manchester United the following October and the frolicking at Stamford Bridge after securing survival at the end of their first top\xe2\x80\x91flight season for 46 years. Even in this, a harrowing second season, there were fleeting highlights, chiefly the pair of wins that make Huddersfield the only team to have done the double over Wolves, a club who have thrived since promotion thanks partly to resources Huddersfield do not have. But they do have some resources and a key reason why this season wound up being such a slog is that last summer they did not spend as shrewdly as in the two previous years. Competing against clubs with far more wealth, they needed every signing to prove a bargain and instead they have paid the price for flawed recruitment. Most obviously for a team that had been promoted with a negative goal difference and survived their first season in the top flight despite being the joint-lowest scorers, Huddersfield needed to reinforce their firepower. They figured that meant improving the supply to the strikers, so three of their five newcomers were wingers. But their manager at the time, David Wagner, quickly became convinced that Ramadan Sobhi, Adama Diakhaby and Isaac Mbenza were not ready to make the desired impact so he started the season in a system without wingers, hoping instead full-backs such as Chris L\xc3\xb6we and Florent Hadergjonaj could be converted into wing-backs. The general play showed signs of evolution \xe2\x80\x93 they had more possession and were more expansive \xe2\x80\x93 but they remained damningly blunt. Their lone front man, either Steve Mouni\xc3\xa9 or Laurent Depo\xc3\xaetre, was under pressure to convert the few chances created and usually he flopped. Yet Huddersfield were tantalisingly close to being competitive. An apt moment came in early December. They were on a good run \xe2\x80\x93 having beaten Fulham, drawn at West Ham and won at Wolves \xe2\x80\x93 and went 1-0 up against Brighton, whereupon, in the 32nd minute, Mouni\xc3\xa9 was harshly sent off. Brighton fought back to win 2-1 and Huddersfield\xe2\x80\x99s sense that things were gradually coming together fell apart. They did not win again for nearly three months. Wagner, once the mastermind and embodiment of the indomitable underdog spirit, succumbed to a fear that seemed almost fatalistic. His tactics grew more negative and his legitimate complaints about bad luck sounded like the wails of a man who felt he was trying to thwart the inevitable. He had already told the club the struggle was taking a toll. He left in January in the wake of a 0-0 draw at Cardiff when Wagner was exasperated by the referee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to award his team a penalty and then overturn it. A more successful venture into the transfer market in January would have helped the new manager, Jan Siewert, stage an unlikely escape but the club, already adrift, decided that was a gamble they could not take. Karlan Grant, a 21-year-old striker signed for \xc2\xa32m from Charlton, was the only significant arrival. It seemed as if the club were building for next season. Siewert is cultivating a more attacking approach, several young players are emerging \xe2\x80\x93 such as Lewis O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, who will return from a season on loan at Bradford \xe2\x80\x93 and Grant has shown signs of developing into a striker who could prosper in the Championship. Huddersfield always knew there were limits to what they could achieve. Which is why there were limits to what they were willing to risk. They never went mad. Relegation will not cripple them financially because they spent within their means, even if the squad now contains the 15 most expensive players in their history. Theirs is by far the division\xe2\x80\x99s lowest wage budget and the contracts of practically all their recruits since promotion allow for hefty pay cuts in the event of going down. Although there is no great beef between the clubs, Huddersfield might take small solace from the fact they are likely to be followed back into the Championship by Fulham, who splurged more than \xc2\xa3100m last summer in an attempt to gain a foothold in the Premier League but are set to leave after one campaign. Huddersfield can also take satisfaction from the knowledge that while Fulham leave to a soundtrack of Craven Cottage regulars protesting about being ripped off at the turnstiles, Huddersfield have kept ticket prices low so that fans could share the journey and perhaps keep coming when the most glamorous clubs are no longer among the visitors. That is part of the legacy that the club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Dean Hoyle, began talking about almost immediately after promotion. Another part is more tangible \xe2\x80\x93 a new training ground costing up to \xc2\xa320m and upon which work should be finished around the end of next season. Huddersfield could be on their way back to the Premier League by then.'"
3,b'Football,"b'Football\xe2\x80\x99s double jeopardy will take Forestieri racism case into extra timeIt is coming up for seven years now since John Terry found himself in the dock of Westminster magistrates court on charges of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand and, though I could never say sitting through that week-long trial was a particularly fulfilling experience, there is one memory that offers some light relief amid all the other numbing details. It goes back to the penultimate day, when Terry was being taken through some of the evidence related to his exchange of words with Ferdinand, then of QPR, and having to repeat some of it for the benefit of the court. Terry was obediently following the instructions, albeit not looking absolutely sure what purpose it served, until he was asked to let the court know the number of times he had been sent off throughout his Chelsea career. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you say \xe2\x80\x93 please \xe2\x80\x93 four times?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his QC, George Carter-Stephenson. At which point Terry nodded again. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease \xe2\x80\xa6 please \xe2\x80\xa6 please \xe2\x80\xa6 please.\xe2\x80\x9d And even now, all these years on, I am still not absolutely sure he understood why the courtroom was filled with awkward laughter. OK, it is not exactly something Ferdinand will remember too fondly after a trial that tested even this newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s policy of opting not to pebbledash its pages with asterisks. It is not often an incident from a professional football match ends up in criminal proceedings and, as we have been reminded in the case of Sheffield Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Fernando Forestieri, it is not straightforward getting a successful prosecution. Terry got off despite admitting that he shouted the words \xe2\x80\x9cfucking black cunt\xe2\x80\x9d towards Ferdinand (or \xe2\x80\x9cfucking black cunt?\xe2\x80\x9d with an all-important question mark, his defence argued, claiming it was Terry\xe2\x80\x99s shocked response to Ferdinand accusing him of uttering those words). Forestieri has also been acquitted and, again, his trial threw up some unexpected angles bearing in mind one of the main arguments put forward on his behalf was that the player making the allegations must have misheard because the crowd was so noisy. The crowd, for the record, was 3,599, for the relevant pre-season friendly at what we are supposed to call the One Call Stadium these days. Or as you and I probably know it: Field Mill. Which, certainly from my experience, is hardly the Ali Sami Yen, decibels\xe2\x80\x91wise. The player in question is Krystian Pearce, the captain of Mansfield Town, who alleges he was called a \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d and was so infuriated by what he heard that a few minutes later, in the first of two confrontations between the different sets of players (the second of which involved 40 people, with coaches and staff also piling in), his manager, David Flitcroft, felt it necessary to go all the way to the centre circle to escort him off the pitch. As is the protocol, Pearce had reported what he heard to the referee, John Brooks, who, in turn, had informed the fourth official, David Plowright. Flitcroft had been told, therefore, there had been an alleged racial slur even before a wild foul by Forestieri on another player instigated the first confrontation. Pearce, according to Flitcroft, was visibly upset, eyes glazed over, in a way the manager had never seen before. So upset, in fact, that when Pearce did finally compose himself after the game the player went into the opposition dressing room, alone, to ask Forestieri to apologise and admit what he had done. Forestieri denied it and Pearce, still enraged, sent a message later that evening to a WhatsApp group comprising his two brothers and some close friends: \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone ever sees Forestieri swing on him immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d What Pearce could not provide for the court was a witness who had heard the exchange. His row with Forestieri was not in anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s earshot. Forestieri was not short of defence witnesses \xe2\x80\x93 the Sheffield Wednesday assistant manager, Lee Bullen, the goalkeeping coach, Nicky Weaver, and the club\xe2\x80\x99s Kosovo striker, Atdhe Nuhiu \xe2\x80\x93 and told the court the insults were directed, in Spanish, at his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s mother (\xe2\x80\x9cla concha de tu madre\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than the colour of his skin. In other words, it boiled down to one man\xe2\x80\x99s word against another and, on that basis, nobody should be surprised it ended as it did: not guilty. Even though \xe2\x80\x93 and this bit is important \xe2\x80\x93 the district judge, Jonathan Taffe, made it clear in his conclusion that he was not certain whatsoever that Pearce had, as suggested, misheard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible, albeit in my judgment unlikely,\xe2\x80\x9d Taffe said. Yet the fact it was possible meant he could not be satisfied \xe2\x80\x9cto a criminal standard\xe2\x80\x9d that the offending word was used. And fair enough: Forestieri\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, like Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s, was described as \xe2\x80\x9cclear and consistent\xe2\x80\x9d. It would have been difficult for any court to convict him without any corroborative evidence and, as Forestieri has subsequently pointed out, the question should probably be asked of the Crown Prosecution Service why it charged him when the judicial system requires cases to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. That is the difference with the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary system, which determines cases on the balance of probabilities and, as such, has a much wider scope to rule in favour of the player making the allegations. All of which explains why the FA\xe2\x80\x99s case against Sophie Jones, the Sheffield United Women\xe2\x80\x99s player, for allegedly making monkey noises at Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Renee Hector was found proven when the reality is there would be very little chance, with none of the other players hearing the same, that a criminal court would have had enough evidence to find her guilty. Jones accused the FA of putting together a \xe2\x80\x9ckangaroo court\xe2\x80\x9d and said she was so disgusted by the verdict and five-match suspension she was quitting the sport for good. Unfortunately for Forestieri, who was born in Argentina to Italian parents and moved to Genoa at the age of 16, that is just the way the sport operates and, as Terry can testify, being innocent in the eyes of the law does not mean the football authorities will be so obliging. Terry\xe2\x80\x99s supporters might have popped open a bottle of pink Cava in the public gallery to celebrate his acquittal but he was charged by the FA within two weeks, then banned for four matches and fined \xc2\xa3220,000. The minimum punishment now is five games and, if Forestieri doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it already, he will soon become aware that the FA is already in contact with Nottinghamshire police with a view to putting together its own case against him. Forestieri has already been banned for three games because of his part in the brawl. But this is far from over. Is the system fair? That is the really divisive issue here but, in fairness to the FA, it is duty-bound to investigate \xe2\x80\x93 and if, as expected, it does lead to Forestieri facing another disciplinary hearing the relevant panel will at least possess a greater understanding of the sport than was demonstrated during his appearance at Mansfield magistrates court. There were certainly some strange moments if you consider that at one point the police officer in charge of the investigation was grilled about his reasons for not putting out an advertisement, presumably in the local paper, asking to speak to members of the crowd. Though that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as perplexing as the questions that were put to Brooks when the referee gave evidence from the witness box about the events leading to Pearce, who was booked for pushing Forestieri, being taken off the pitch. The issue, of course, was finding out what had upset him so badly. Lisa Judge, defending Forestieri, referred to the booking and asked Brooks to confirm that yellow cards, totted up, could be damaging for a footballer, in terms of suspensions and damaging the prospects of future moves. Which was an interesting line to take at any time \xe2\x80\x93 but especially relating to a pre-season fixture when yellow cards had no relevance. As for Forestieri, one of the other oddities was that he told the court via his interpreter that he could not speak good English but, judging by his own account of what was said, appeared to have a reasonable grasp of the language, after all. Pearce, he said, had accused him of diving to try to win a penalty and then fouled him without a free-kick being awarded. Forestieri admitted swearing at his opponent and, at that stage, that their argument was in English. Mansfield were winning 2-1 and, according to Forestieri, Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s response was to offer to sign an autograph for the Championship player at the end of the game. Pearce then made a mess of an attempted clearance and Forestieri claimed to have told him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want your autograph when your left foot is so shit?\xe2\x80\x9d At which point you may recall that Terry\xe2\x80\x99s flare-up with Ferdinand also started with two players arguing over a penalty, swapping insults and then something as trivial and daft as Terry pretending his opponent had stinky breath, wafting his hand in front of his nose and putting on a look of feigned disgust, as if someone at the back of the class had let off a stink-bomb. Terry described himself during that trial as \xe2\x80\x9cthe victim \xe2\x80\x93 stitched up good and proper\xe2\x80\x9d and Forestieri left the same impression. Now he should probably expect an announcement from FA headquarters to confirm there is still another twist to this story. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder if Bassini is passed fit for Bolton Laurence Bassini was such a caring and diligent owner for Watford that, even after all that unfortunate business once he had left the club, he made sure to text Frank Smith, the deputy sports editor of the Watford Observer, after the team had lost to Crystal Palace in the 2013 Championship playoffs. The first message will give you a flavour. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is the feeling in the town now?\xe2\x80\x9d it read. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me the feeling is amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d And on he went, making the point that he was happy for the newspaper to print every word. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat goes around comes around,\xe2\x80\x9d was another. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my happiest memory of Watford ... print this in the paper, Laurence Bassini ... I have to go now and open the champagne ... all my love to Watford.\xe2\x80\x9d Bassini has been declared a bankrupt twice and, after the first occasion, changed his name from Bazini to get a fresh start. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t do him much good and, shortly before those charming messages to the local newspaper, he was found guilty by an independent disciplinary commission of misconduct and dishonesty relating to his financial dealings at Watford. Bassini was found to have \xe2\x80\x9cpractised secrecy and deception\xe2\x80\x9d and banned from holding a position of authority with any Football League club for three years. Bassini, in short, would come out somewhere near the top if you were to draw up a list of the bluffers and chancers who have passed through the sport. He is also now announcing that he is close to a takeover of Bolton Wanderers and, worse, it appears from what he says the Football League is going to wave it through. Yes, it is probably worth not taking everything he says at face value just yet. No apologies here, however, for wondering whether this is going to be the final calamity of Shaun Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s time as the league\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive. Or whether there will ever come a day when the relevant people at league HQ find any use for that yellowing scrap of paper formerly known as the fit and proper person\xe2\x80\x99s test.'"
4,"b""Call it budget or campaign launch","b""Call it budget or campaign launch, it's a tough ask for FrydenbergMost people I suspect are still unaware that on Tuesday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will be handing down a budget. Given the horrific and at times absurd events of the past month, attention has been almost anywhere but on economic matters. The shift in dates to allow for a May election has also meant the government has been denied the usual April to leak details and take control of the narrative. It all makes for a very weird budget. Because an election is just weeks away, the budget is in effect the election campaign launch, and because no spending from the budget will occur before the election, the budget figures essentially set the parameters for the campaign. That\xe2\x80\x99s why articles suggesting a boom in company tax revenue will give Scott Morrison a war chest are rather odd \xe2\x80\x93 Bill Shorten gets to use that war chest as well, and because the election is so close it also gives him a rather handy advantage. Normally the budget in reply speech is a bit of a bloodless affair, but this time around Shorten can use it as his own de-facto campaign launch \xe2\x80\x93 and the last major political speech before the PM drives to Yarralumla. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few times where incumbency is somewhat of a disadvantage. Being in charge of the Treasury means the government has to essentially make the first bid; Shorten and Chris Bowen can do as Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan did and keep what they like, dump what they don\xe2\x80\x99t and outspend them where they want to. For the ALP the added advantage is Shorten can stand and deliver lines pretty much built on those he has spoken for the past five years \xe2\x80\x93 workers are missing out, the company tax cuts have not flowed through to better wage growth; the government has got it wrong. For Frydenberg, in his first budget, the task is much more difficult. While a spend-a-thon budget prior to an election is to be expected, the economic scenario under which the budget is being delivered is very much different from what the government would have been hoping. The past six months of 2018 saw a major slowing of the economy \xe2\x80\x93 growing by just 0.7% in trend terms \xe2\x80\x93 the slowest six months of growth since 2008. Inflationary expectations have nosedived, and the interest rates for government bonds around the world have also fallen as investors start feeling the chill of a recession on the horizon. In such circumstance what the budget needs to deliver is not just votes but economic growth \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. stimulus \xe2\x80\x93 and yet this is a word the government will be very loth to utter. In an interview with the AFR\xe2\x80\x99s Phil Coorey and John Kehoe, the treasurer responded to suggestions that the budget would contain handouts and tax cuts as \xe2\x80\x9cstimulus\xe2\x80\x9d by saying \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s your word, I\xe2\x80\x99m not using that word\xe2\x80\x9d. The reason of course is that \xe2\x80\x9cstimulus\xe2\x80\x9d is redolent of the Rudd/Swan budgets during the GFC, and suggests that things are going poorly. Instead, the treasurer will talk about \xe2\x80\x9cpro-growth\xe2\x80\x9d. But really, one-off payments to pensioners are pro-growth in the way that heart surgery is pro-life \xe2\x80\x93 you don\xe2\x80\x99t do it unless you need to and it is not something you do when things are going according to plan. The Liberal party bet the farm on pro-company policies leading to better wages and stronger growth. They have seen unemployment fall, and yet also a rise in the share of part-time work and people working multiple jobs. The unemployment rate went below 5% in February \xe2\x80\x93 the lowest rate since June 2011. And yet at that time the underemployment rate was 6.9%; now it is 8.1%. Back then private sector wages were growing at 3.8%; now they\xe2\x80\x99re growing at 2.3%. The long-hoped-for return of wage rises of around 3% have not come and now there are signs the slowing economy is affecting jobs, with the ABS this week revealing that the growth of job vacancies is at its slowest for two years. Governments want to go into an election with some sense that what they have been doing has delivered, not that they now need to convince you they have heard your complaints. The Liberal party delivered tax cuts to businesses and those on above-average and high incomes. Now, due to both political and economic necessity, they are having to change tack, all the while hoping voters believe this is just part of some master economic strategy that is going as expected. Josh Frydenberg has been handed one of the more unenviable tasks of any treasurer \xe2\x80\x93 deliver a first budget and a path to an election that essentially counters the path taken by his now leader when he was treasurer. It is a tough ask, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think hoping voters think pro-growth is better sounding than stimulus is going to be enough. \xe2\x80\xa2 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"""
5,b'Labour,"b'Labour\xe2\x80\x99s plan for a people\xe2\x80\x99s vote on the final Brexit deal can heal the countryLike someone who works with heavy machinery or lives next to a railway line, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to get so accustomed to the ugly noise that blasts out of our political system that you don\xe2\x80\x99t always hear it. But whenever I step back, I can tell the sound of our politics has become shriller and angrier, particularly since the referendum of 2016 that split our country in half. Yet, among the sound and fury, there are the beginnings of a different tone, quietly demanding to be heard. Last Saturday, I went on the march for a people\xe2\x80\x99s vote. It was huge and passionate but there was also a calmness and dignity in this million-strong protest that I have not always experienced in the past few years. Then, on Wednesday night, my party came together around a position on Brexit that can unite our members, voters, MPs and, yes, the leadership too. I respect the different judgments reached by some of our MPs \xe2\x80\x93 none of these decisions is easy \xe2\x80\x93 but more than 80% of Labour MPs backed Margaret Beckett\xe2\x80\x99s motion saying that any deal to leave the EU should not be pushed through by parliament unless it has also been approved by the people. This is a compromise position that provides a clear path to break the deadlock. Whether you voted Leave, like the majority of people in my area did, or whether you voted Remain, the current parliamentary paralysis works for no one. Our plan recognises that any Brexit deal agreed by this parliament is going to be so different from that promised three years ago \xe2\x80\x93 and so potentially costly to our economy and communities, it\xe2\x80\x99s only reasonable to let the people decide whether to accept it. If parliament imposes a Brexit deal on the nation \xe2\x80\x93 or decides to scrap Brexit altogether without checking with voters \xe2\x80\x93 it would seem undemocratic in the extreme. We now have until 12 April to either agree a new path to a viable Brexit deal, with an extension to article 50 that means taking part in European elections, or crash out with no deal. I think Labour should embrace European elections just as we should welcome a general election that might get rid of this broken government. If we go into either contest with a positive policy on Brexit and say any final deal must be put back to the people, I am confident Labour can win. We already have a fund raised by local parties to pay for the campaign and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked our NEC to develop a plan to get grassroots members involved in selecting candidates. Ministers have started saying that taking part in EU elections would be somehow be an \xe2\x80\x9caffront to democracy\xe2\x80\x9d. They no longer make the case for a stronger economy, \xc2\xa3350m extra every week for the NHS or amazing new trade deals negotiated by Global Britain. All they have got left in their locker is a promise to give us fewer chances to vote. The Tories are right to be frightened of elections. Their internal war over Europe, waged for the past 30 years, has led the country to this point. They\xe2\x80\x99ve messed up Brexit that has gone from chaos to national humiliation and are completely incapable of providing the leadership we need. In contrast, Labour emerged from the past week stronger and more united. Our values have always been internationalist and outward-looking. The biggest gains we made in 2017 were among young people who share those values and want to \xe2\x80\x9cbuild bridges, not walls\xe2\x80\x9d. It falls to Labour to develop a modern programme of change to address the root causes of why 52% voted for Brexit. Whenever a final deal is reached, and whatever that deal eventually looks like, I think this question can only be truly settled by giving the decision to the people. Our plan to put any final Brexit deal back to the people has already begun to unite the Labour party. And, if the last referendum divided our country, I believe a new one might help heal it. \xe2\x80\xa2 Tom Watson is the deputy leader of the Labour party'"
0,b'Furious Tory MPs tell May,"b'Furious Tory MPs tell May: we\xe2\x80\x99ll block snap Brexit electionConservative MPs from across the party are threatening to vote down any attempt by Theresa May to lead them into a snap election, warning it would split the Tories and exacerbate the Brexit crisis. In a sign of the collapse in authority suffered by the prime minister, cabinet ministers are among those warning that there will be a serious campaign by Conservative MPs to vote against an election headed by May, a move she hinted at last week to break the Brexit deadlock. The threat of an election immediately angered both pro-Brexit and pro-Remain MPs. May would need a two-thirds majority in the Commons to secure one, meaning a serious rebellion by Tories could block it. May would then be forced to secure an election by backing a no-confidence vote in her own government, which only requires a simple majority of MPs. Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we have a general election before Brexit is resolved, it will only make things worse.\xe2\x80\x9d Antoinette Sandbach, a Tory MP who backs another referendum being held on any deal agreed by parliament, said she would vote against calling an election. \xe2\x80\x9cThe answer is not a general election, and I would vote against that. We need to find a way forward in parliament and then put that to the people in a confirmatory referendum.\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Francois, a member of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, said there was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a chance\xe2\x80\x9d that Conservative MPs would back an election under May. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Of course they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 not after last time. And remember, she needs a super majority to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d With contenders for the Tory leadership already plotting their route to replace May ahead of another perilous week for her premiership, it emerged that: \xe2\x80\xa2 Pro-Brexit ministers are threatening to resign should May agree to adopt a permanent customs union with the EU this week. \xe2\x80\xa2 A new group of moderate Conservatives, led by Amber Rudd, has been organising in an attempt to stop the party moving further to the right under a new leader. \xe2\x80\xa2 Several more Tories are poised to support the idea of a referendum on any deal eventually passed by parliament. Another highly unpredictable week could see parliament force May to adopt a soft Brexit, and another attempt to pass her deal. More than 100 Tory MPs have also signed a letter calling on May to rule out a long extension to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s EU membership, even if that means backing a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, Labour\xe2\x80\x99s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said his party should \xe2\x80\x9cembrace\xe2\x80\x9d the European elections on 23 May in the event of a Brexit extension, as he re-emphasised Labour\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to a referendum to confirm any deal agreed by parliament. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now have until April 12th to either agree a new path to a viable Brexit deal, with an extension to article 50 that means taking part in European elections, or crash out with no deal,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes on theguardian.com. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Labour should embrace European elections just as we should welcome a general election that might get rid of this broken government. If we go into either contest with a positive policy on Brexit and say any final deal must be put back to the people, I am confident Labour can win.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe already have a fund raised by local parties to pay for the campaign and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked our NEC [National Executive Committee] to develop a plan to get grassroots members involved in selecting candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d Senior government ministers are now openly contemplating a long delay or no Brexit to avoid crashing out. Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, wrote to a constituent that May\xe2\x80\x99s deal \xe2\x80\x9cis dead\xe2\x80\x9d. She added: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some stark choices. For me it has to be in the direction of a long extension to article 50 and/or no Brexit rather than crashing out.\xe2\x80\x9d Some cabinet ministers now want to vote for a softer Brexit in a new round of indicative votes on Brexit options on Monday. May is set to talk to her cabinet on a conference call on Sunday. When the process took place last week, the cabinet was forced to abstain. Handing the cabinet the right to vote could be enough to secure a majority for a permanent customs union with the EU \xe2\x80\x93 a plan that would stop Britain signing its own trade agreements but would deal with many of the border issues. May appeared to suggest to MPs on Friday that she could call an election if her Brexit deal was not passed, saying parliament was \xe2\x80\x9creaching the limits of this process\xe2\x80\x9d. However, several influential Tory figures and ministers said there was a high risk Conservative MPs would vote against an election with May at the helm. One cabinet minister said they believed many Tories would vote down an election, adding that other parties such as the newly-formed Change UK group would also oppose it. Nigel Evans, executive secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said an election was a terrible idea that the cabinet would block. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the cabinet would allow her to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTheresa May cannot call an election, she cannot be the leader who would lead us into it. The party would not tolerate it.\xe2\x80\x9d Former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, who resigned last week after voting in favour of MPs taking control of the Brexit process also made clear he was strongly opposed to the idea of an early election: \xe2\x80\x9cI would be profoundly disturbed by a general election in the current circumstances of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Another minister said it would \xe2\x80\x9cmerely add more chaos to the chaos\xe2\x80\x9d. One influential Tory said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow many Tory MPs would actually want May to fight another election? Twenty? Half the cabinet would be against the idea. A huge number would vote against.\xe2\x80\x9d However, other Tories predicted that while feelings were running high, May would be able to secure enough support for an election if she decided to call one. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a great look for an MP to avoid their electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d said one former cabinet minister. Another MP against an election said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe would be honour-bound to vote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d An Opinium poll for the Observer reveals that May\xe2\x80\x99s lead over Jeremy Corbyn on who would be the best prime minister has halved since last month, dropping from 15 points to 7 points. When Tory leadership hopefuls were pitted against Corbyn, Boris Johnson was the only one who had a lead over the Labour leader. A quarter of voters (25%) thought Johnson would be the best prime minister, compared with 24% for Corbyn.'"
